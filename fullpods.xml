James &quot;Iron Cowboy&quot; Lawrence



I&#039;m exploding with excitement about this week&#039;s hotly anticipated show.

Today I sit down with James Lawrence -- aka The Iron Cowboy -- fresh on the heels of completing an absolutely unprecedented and mind-boggling 50 ironman-distance triathlons in 50 states in just 50 days.

I honestly believe this is one of the greatest achievements in the history of (voluntary) human endurance.

For the uninitiated, consider swimming 2.4 miles, pedaling your bike 112 miles and then running a marathon, 26.2 miles. After quickly eating and bathing, you enjoy anywhere from two to four hours of shut eye, usually in the back of a Subaru as it drives through the night to meet dawn in an adjoining state. Then you heave your weary bones up, eat, get dressed and do it all over again. Every single day. 50 days in row, across each and every one of the 50 states -- including Hawaii and Alaska -- without one single day off.

Just think about that for a moment. Let it sink in.

During James&#039;initial appearance on the podcast (RRP 149)just prior to his 50/50/50 attempt, I went on record here and on various media outlets likeTriathlete.comvoicing my concern that James just might have aimed a bit too high.

As someone who did 5 ironman-distance triathlons in a row on each of the 5 Hawaiian Islands, I happen to have a little experience in this arena. Admittedly my accomplishments now seem paltry (almost embarrassing) by comparison, the fact remains that I happen to be one of the few people on the planet who can truly understand, appreciate and deeply empathize with the abyss James would inevitably face, battle, endure and be forced to overcome in order to complete his extraordinary journey intact.

I know what it&#039;s like to meet unforeseen obstacles that threaten to imperil the mission. I know what it&#039;s like to fall asleep on your bike. I know what it&#039;s like to have saddle sores so painful you can&#039;t sit down. I know what it&#039;s like to run through the night, hallucinating. And I know what it&#039;s like when that inevitable moment arises and you ask yourself: what am I doing to myself?

But James and his entire family were all in from the get go. To underwrite the endeavor, they even sold their house and put all their earthly possessions in storage. So never for a second did I doubt his level of commitment. I knew he could complete 50 ironman-distance triathlons in 50 states. It was the 50 days part that bent my brain. Certainly he&#039;ll have to take at least one day off, right? Maybe two. In my mind, I predicted at least three intermittent rest days.

James, you proved me wrong. You proved the world wrong.

And I couldn’t be happier. Or more proud. It&#039;s not just that you did what you said you would do. It&#039;s the way you did it. It was your composure. It was you tremendous grace under fire. Your selflessness in service toa greater cause.All fueled by an attitude of gratitude.

On a last minute whim, I decided to show up unannounced in Utah to surprise James, join him on his final marathon jaunt, and witness the conclusion first hand. An experience I will never forget, it was thrilling and emotional to be running just off his shoulder as he crossed his historic finish line, accomplished his goal, embraced his family and raised his fist in victory to the deafening cheers of 3,600 fans in solidarity. Like a boss. Like Maximus in &#039;Gladiator&#039;.

Enjoy my video surprising James on the final day plus some podcast behind the scenes:



What made the whole affair even more special is that it did not play out under the klieg lights of national television, but rather in relative initial obscurity. But as word began to slowly spread across the tentacles of social media,</itunes:summary>

James "Iron Cowboy" Lawrence



I'm exploding with excitement about this week's hotly anticipated show.

An experience I will never forget, it was thrilling and emotional to be running just off his shoulder as he crossed his historic finish line, accomplished his goal, embraced his family and raised his fist in victory to the deafening cheers of 3,600 fans in solidarity. Like a boss. Like Maximus in 'Gladiator'.

Enjoy my video surprising James on the final day plus some podcast behind the scenes:



What made the whole affair even more special is that it did not play out under the klieg lights of national television, but rather in relative initial obscurity. But as word began to slowly spread across the tentacles of social media, a true grass roots movement of community support gradually emerged. Interest grew, luring an exponential increase in attention with each successive day. By the time James' reached his Utah apogee, hundreds of thousands of people -- most of which had zero previous interest in triathlon -- had become enraptured by the unfolding drama, starting each morning by logging in to theIron Cowboy Facebook Pagewith just one question in mind:

Is he still alive?

But understand that this was no individual achievement. It was truly a team effort. In fact, James' success is inextricably linked to the incredible support of family, friends, sponsors and the ever expanding community of people that showed up in each and every state to help him cross each consecutive finish line.

Today it's my privilege to bring to you the first comprehensive, completely uncut recap of James' historic and extraordinary accomplishment.

Not only do I get James’ first-hand observations on the whole affair, I also get his wife Sunny Jo’s perspective. I talk with his precocious eldest daughter Lucy about what it was like running the last 5K of every one of the 50 marathons in all 50 states -- a remarkable achievement in it's own right! -- with her dad. I also take the temperature of James' two primary crew chiefs, Aaron Hopkinson and Casey Robles. Aptly dubbed The Wingmen, the comedic wonder twins were essential to meeting James' every need while simultaneously serving up much needed levity along the way.

Case in point? The Wingmen showed up for the podcast in nothing but grass skirt speedoes. Plantpower!

So how did this humble husband and father of five -- a man who considers himself very average in terms of genetic athletic gifts -- succeed in accomplishing a goal so unfathomable nobody thought it possible?

Perhaps it was his impenetrable sense of self-belief. His extraordinary conviction. Or his strong core of support. I'd say all of the above.

James will tell you it was 80% mental.

Among other things, this conversation explores:

	James' perception of his achievement
	maintaining motivation &amp; focus
	feeding &amp; fueling strategies
	dealing with sleep deprivation &amp; exhaustion
	relying on his 'Iron Cowboy' alter-ego
	the impact on Sunny &amp; the kids
	the example set for his children
	the crucial role of crew support
	his approach to daily recovery
	the lowest moments
	the importance of accepting help
	dealing with controversy and external negativity; and
	his commitment to combating childhood obesity

Final note: I get emotional at the end -- a first for me on this podcast. Perhaps a tribute to how much it meant to me personally to see James succeed. So there’s that to look forward to.

What's holding you back from tackling your dream? I'd love to hear about it in the comments section below.

I sincerely hope you enjoy this very special conversation.

		<itunes:summary>&quot;Being grateful is the bridge between the world of nightmares and the world where we are free to say no.

James Altucher



I&#039;m so intimidated.

This week Julie and I are joined by the dynamic duo of the Choose Yourself era themselves, James and Claudia Altucher -- a prolific couple changing the world with insights that are empowering millions to live more dynamic, authentic lives.

When someone fires off a long list of occupations in conversation, my instinct tells me that person probably isn&#039;t great at any of them. James is not that guy. Abundant in talent. A true polymath with just the right amount of self-deprecation and pitch perfect comedic timing. Blogger, bestselling author, podcaster, public speaker, investor, entrepreneur, columnist, and humorist, he seemingly does it all.

Oh yeah, he&#039;s also a nationally ranked chess master.

James had made millions, lost millions and made millions again. Maybe he&#039;ll lose it again. I don&#039;t know. He’s started and run something like 20 companies. Then there&#039;s a slew of venture capital, hedge, angel and sundry other funds he ran. Maybe he still runs them. I don&#039;t know that either. In fact, I don&#039;t understand any of it.

James&#039; Altucher Confidential is one of the most widely read blogs on the internet, amassing over 15 million readers since its 2010 inception.

The James Altucher Show debuted as the #1 podcast on all of iTunes last year.

I think he&#039;s written 13 books. It could be 16. I can&#039;t keep track. He writes faster than I can read.

My favorite is the Wall Street Journal Best Seller Choose Yourself. A primer for anyone seeking firmer control of destiny, it&#039;s a prescient and highly entertaining look at how new and unprecedented tools, technology and economic forces have suddenly emerged to make it possible for individuals to create art, careers, success, fulfillment and change the world without permission from the gatekeepers of yore.

When you finish that book, then read The Power of No -- also a Wall Street Journal Best Seller. Two things you need to know about this book: (1) it&#039;s really great; and (2) learning how and when to say no is, like, really important.

Wait, there&#039;s a third thing: it was co-authored by James&#039; wife Claudia.

In many ways James&#039; perfect match, the Argentinian-born Claudia is also a widely acclaimed multi-hyphenate. Writer, podcaster and yoga aficionado, she has written or co-written three books, including the recently released Become An Idea Machine. You can find her Yoga Podcast on iTunes and read her musings at ClaudiaYoga.com. But I don&#039;t know how much longer she can keep this up because any day now she&#039;s going to be named the new CEO of Twitter.

Am I joking?Read this and you tell me.

I had James onmy podcasta while ago. Then I didhis podcast.Then Julie didClaudia&#039;s podcast.They fell in love. I was already in love with James.

The only thing? None of us had ever met in person. Until now.

Wonder twin powers activate!

I&#039;m not sure whose podcast we did. We just hit record and started freestyling. I thought we were interviewing James and Claudia but now I think I have it all backwards.

Let&#039;s call it a crosscast.

Here&#039;s just a few of the many subjects that came up:

	cultivating positive relationships with your children
	the power of vulnerability
	divine love vs. human love
	the importance of support systems
	creating success doing what you love
	the importance of relevance
	navigating negativity through meditation and service
	practicing neutral compassion

James and Claudia are special people. Listen in and I&#039;ll think you&#039;ll agree.

Seamus Mullen



Imagine yourself so debilitated by a battery of chronic ailments you can barely get out of bed. Merely walking down a simple flight of stairs or lifting a a book is excruciating. Knife-like pains cause you to scream so loudly, your neighbor calls 911. Then one day you collapse at work and awake in the hospital to discover you have suffered 36 embolisms that are filling your lungs with blood so quickly, drowning is a very real possibility.

Now imagine yourself a couple years later in a tropical jungle competing in La Ruta Del Conquistadores. Widely considered one of the toughest endurance challenges on the planet, La Ruta is a 3-day, 161-mile mountain bike race with over 29,000 feet of climbing that traverses Costa Rica from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea.

This is the incredible arc of today&#039;s guest, Seamus Mullen.

An award-winning New York City chef, restaurateur and cookbook author known for his inventive yet approachable Spanish cuisine, Seamus is the proprietor of several restaurants, including Tertulia (a finalist for the James Beard Foundation Award for &quot;Best New Restaurant&quot;), El Colmado, a Spanish tapas and wine bar at Gotham West Market, and Sea Containers at Mondrian London.

A semi-finalist for Best Chef NYC by the James Beard Foundation 3 years in a row, Seamus was also one of 3 finalists on the Food Network’s The Next Iron Chef. He frequents the popular Food Network series Chopped and Beat Bobby Flay as a featured judge and is a recurring guest on programs such as The Today Show, The Martha Stewart Show, and CBS This Morning.

But the important things in life snapped into focus for Seamus in 2007 when he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that precipitated a near death experience and quite literally brought him to his knees.

A once avid cyclist who raced competitively in his twenties, Seamus suddenly found himself unable to properly function.

Pedal a bike? A pipe dream.

Seamus was faced with a choice. Either live out the remainder of his days with unbearable suffering, or take matters into his own hands. He chose the latter.

It wasn&#039;t easy. And it wasn&#039;t overnight. But by making a decision to make wellness his number one priority; by harnessing the power of holistic, functional medicine; and by rebooting his lifestyle wholesale, Seamus Mullen ultimately healed himself.

By virtue of working with people like lifestyle architect Ari Meisel and functional medicine doctor and RRP alumnus Frank Lipman (clickhereto listen to my podcast with Frank), Seamus can now add wellness advocate and authority to his already impressive resume. And when he&#039;s not racing his bike across Costa Rica, he&#039;s pedaling for charity or lost on one of his many cycling and motorcycle adventures exploring remote parts of the planet.

Seamus has shared his amazing story of renewal with major publications like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and through his bi-monthly column in Men’s Journal. He is currently making a documentary about his journey called Back on the Bike.

Seamus is a great guy and we had a fantastic conversation that explores all the aforementioned topics and then some, including:

	the importance of healthy school lunch programs
	the story behind his Rheumatoid Arthritis
	the failure of traditional RA treatment protocols
	symptomatic treatment vs. true healing methodology
	his vivid near-death experience
	understanding the importance of physical/mental health
	the on-going commitment to growth &amp; change
	the importance of a healthy microbiome
	the importance of positive support &amp; self-belief

	the benefits of eating seasonally

	the importance of positive support &amp; self-belief
	a whole foods approach to health &amp; sustainability
	the benefits of eating seasonally
	the re-invention of food due to a growing food culture

For the record, Seamus isn't vegan (yet - trust me, I'm working on it). But that doesn't mean we can't get along, find plenty of commonalities and agree on a wide range of important issues related to health and wellness. Plus, he did prepare me and John Joseph one of the most unique and incredibly delicious 6 course vegan meals I have ever experienced in my life. So I can more than attest to his culinary genius. Next time you are in NYC, drop by Tertulia in the West Village, tell him you want The Rich Roll Special. Then snap a photo of his (I predict priceless) reaction and send it to me.
I sincerely hope you listen with an open mind and enjoy the conversation.
Is wellness your number one priority? If not, why not? I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below.
Peace + Plants,

Julie Piatt



We&#039;re back with yet another installment of Ask Me Anything, a twist on my typical long-form interview format where Julie and I engage you -- the listener -- by addressing the topics and questions you want discussed.

As a person prone to extremes, I have been spending quite a bit of time lately pondering the importance of balance and moderation in living an optimally fulfilling life.

What is the role of balance when you are pursuing your best self? Is moderation in all things truly an aspirational path?

In short, I am starting to question the premise.

This week Julie and I discuss this personal conundrum at length. Our conversation also explores:

	my experience with Iron Cowboy as he completed his historic 50/50/50
	Julie&#039;s perspective on crewing for me at Ultraman
	stoicism &amp; overcoming obstacles
	how to best serve the needs of &quot;out of the box&quot; children
	the exploration required to discover your passion
	how distractions negatively impact our life path; and
	how to meet the social challenges of living plant-based

Special thanks to Nanette, Doug &amp; David for this week’s questions!
The show concludes withBeloved,written and performed by Julie, aka SriMati, accompanied by Mark Schultz and our sons Tyler &amp; Trapper Piatt.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.
How do you define balance? I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below.

	<itunes:subtitle>&quot;The fact that [doctors] are not given the training to use what is almost universally recognized as the most powerful tool [healthy nutrition] is crazy.&quot; - Michelle McMacken, MD - We need more doctors like Michelle McMacken, MD. - </itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>&quot;The fact that [doctors] are not given the training to use what is almost universally recognized as the most powerful tool [healthy nutrition] is crazy.&quot;

Michelle McMacken, MD



We need more doctors like Michelle McMacken, MD.

Board certified in internal medicine, Dr. McMacken is an assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine, an attending primary care physician at New York City&#039;s Bellevue Hospital Center and director of the Bellevue Adult Weight Management Clinic, where she specializes in plant-based nutrition and lifestyle medicine.

Interestingly, Dr. McMacken wasn&#039;t always all that intrigued by nutrition. Not surprisingly, her medical school experience was woefully lacking in this regard. But after eight years of medical practice, she was becoming progressively distressed by her obesity clinic patients&#039; general inability to get -- and stay -- healthy.

Determined to find better, more sustainable solutions for her patients led to a search engine result for “lifestyle change” that prompted Michelle to attend theAmerican College of Lifestyle Medicine Conference-- a game-changing experience that enlightened her to a holistic, disease preventive perspective on patient care that ultimately reinvigorated and forever altered her medical practice.

Beyond her one on one work with patients, many of which are underprivileged, what is uniquely inspiring about Dr. McMacken is her grant-funded commitment to study evidence-based nutritional protocols and apply the practical knowledge to faculty, colleagues &amp; resident doctors. In other words, she is devoted to educating not only her patients about healthy nutrition, but her fellow medical professionals as well -- filling the much needed gap in our current system of medical education.

This is an enlightening and highly informative conversation that explores:

	the state of medical education with respect to nutrition
	the responsibility of doctors to practice holistic, preventive medicine
	the significance of a plant-based diet in promoting optimal wellness
	Dr. McMacken&#039;s personal &amp; professional path to plant-based nutrition
	the health impact of high protein diets, ketosis &amp; glycogen depletion
	the differences between animal &amp; plant protein
	alkaline/acid-forming foods and their impact on metabolism
	paleo vs. vegan - finding common ground
	the truth behind dietary cholesterol &amp; saturated fat
	the importance of aligning actions with values
	plant-based patient case studies

I sincerely hope you enjoy our discussion.

What is preventing you from a more holistic approach to long-term wellness? I&#039;d love to hear about your personal challenges in the comments section below.

Aussie born, UK-dwelling adventure athlete Luke Tyburski isn’t superman. He’s not famous nor is he a world champion. And he’s the first to say he’s just not that talented. In most ways Luke is a normal bloke. An everyman who decided to face his debilitating battle with clinical depression through the lens of adventure and ultra-endurance sports.

Soccer obsessed as a young boy, from the get go Luke realized he lacked the God-given athletic gifts enjoyed by his teammates. Nonetheless, perseverance prevailed and Luke achieved his life-long dream of traveling the world as a professional footballer.

Unfortunately, that career was cut short by significant, chronic &amp; persistent injuries. What followed was an unexpected yet quite severe bout with acute, clinical depression -- a back hole of desperation that often left him bedridden and teetering on hopelessness.

To escape this prison, Luke dug deep. Through sheer force of will matched with equal parts faith, he compelled his mutinying body, mind and spirit to simply get up, get outside and begin exploring again -- one step at a time.

Having never ran more than 10 kilometers at any one time, and with only six months to prepare, in 2012 Luke conquered the infamousMarathon des Sables,a 250 kilometer, six stage self-sufficient running race across the treacherous and unrelenting sand dunes of the Moroccan Sahara.

Since then he has competed in a variety of adventure races, including theMt. Everest Ultra Marathon.His first ever triathlon? The double ironman distanceDouble Brutal Extreme Triathlon.

My kind of guy.

Currently, Luke&#039;s sights are set on achieving the truly extraordinary — a self-styled 12-day, 2000 kilometer adventure he calls The Ultimate Triathlonthat kicks off in Morocco with a swim across the Straight of Gibraltar before cycling and running the coastline all the way to Monaco.



It’s easy to admire the feats of the truly touched. It’s inspirational. But I cherish sharing stories like Luke&#039;s because they are aspirational. And because relatable, everyman guys like Luke demonstrate that big dreams are possible and accessible for all.

This is a conversation that explores:

	what its like to be clinically depressed
	preparing for The Ultimate Triathlon
	developing confidence as an outmatched youth
	how attention to nutrition changed his game
	the importance of a holistic approach to well-being
	endurance sports as escapism
	the importance of adventurous life
	how the compassion of strangers in Nepal changed his perspective
	what keeps him motivated; and
	how to bridge the gap between inspiration and action

An adventurous life is a worth leading. Luke&#039;s life is well worth the examination. I sincerely hope you enjoy our discussion.

How can you invite more adventure into your life? I&#039;d love to hear about it in the comments section below.

	<itunes:subtitle>&quot;I can honestly say that being vegan is not only the most efficient way to be full-body strong, it’s also the most humane; everyone wins.&quot; - David Carter - It’s one thing to thrive on a plant-based diet as a skinny endurance athlete.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>&quot;I can honestly say that being vegan is not only the most efficient way to be full-body strong, it’s also the most humane; everyone wins.&quot;

David Carter



It’s one thing to thrive on a plant-based diet as a skinny endurance athlete. But what about sports that place a premium on size, speed, agility, power, quickness and just plain brute force?

Is it possible to compete at the highest level of the NFL not as a punt returner, not as a quarterback or even a running back, but as a defensive lineman – a position where only the absolute biggest, baddest, strongest and fastest survive?

Meet David Carter -- aka The 300 Pound Vegan.

Introduced to the game at age 5, David began his football career playing Pop Warner. He made waves at Fontana&#039;s Kaiser High School in Southern California and went on to become a star player at UCLA. In 2011, he was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the 6th round and has since been a bit of a journeyman defensive linebacker, playing for the Dallas Cowboys, the Oakland Raiders and most recently the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Like most athletes, David grew up eating tons of meat, fully adhering to the conventional mythology that in order to become muscle you must consume muscle – the more the better.

But as his career matured, David became plagued by a variety of persistent, chronic injuries including arthritis, tendonitis, nerve damage and chronic muscle fatigue. Not surprising given the nature of his job, but nonetheless devastating -- ailments he simply could not overcome that left him sidelined despite the best sports medicine and rehabilitative resources of the NFL at his disposal.

David soon realized that in order to continue playing, something had to change. He began researching the cause of his conditions, as well as alternative remedies to resolve them at the source. Heavily influenced by a series of documentaries that included Forks Over Knives and the holistic lifestyle habits practiced by his wife Paige, David arrived at a rather counter-intuitive conclusion for an athlete whose professional career relies entirely upon physical prowess and sheer brute force:

all the nutrition he had been relying on to maximize his size and strength was actually killing him.

Therefore, in February 2014, David made a rather radical and quite controversial decision: he adopted a 100% plant-based diet.

Criticism came swift from all sides. Trainers, coaches, friends and fellow players all chimed the familiar refrain: it&#039;s impossible to maintain your weight and strength without meat!

But David has remained steadfast and confident in his decision.

Why? Because a battery of unexpected positive results came and came quickly. Eating entirely plant-based, David experienced more energy. His recovery time was profoundly accelerated. His stamina went through the roof. To the great surprise of his coaches, trainers and teammates, every single one of those nagging, persistent injuries mysteriously corrected themselves and ultimately vanished altogether. All his numbers in the weight room actually went up – this is a guy who can bench 470 and squat 660. Amazingly, he found himself quicker, more agile and responsive than ever. And perhaps most important to David, no living thing had to die in order for him to thrive.

Through football and his off the field advocacy for healthier lifestyles, animal rights and the planet, David is now devoted to a cause greater than his on field performance -- being an example of positive change in the world.

There is quite a bit of feverish intrigue and anticipation about this episode. I&#039;m happy to report this conversation does not disappoint. It&#039;s a special exchange with an exceptional human being that explores:

	a typical day in the life of the NFL
	a peek into the typical NFL diet
	the specifics behind his lifestyle shift
	how he has weathered the criticism
	what exactly he eats on a daily basis
	why he spends his off-season in Costa Rica

		<itunes:summary>&quot;Remember that you cannot control what happens to you. But you can control who you are in the face of what happens to you.&quot;

Julie Piatt



I don&#039;t how long we&#039;ve been together -- 17 years? 16? -- but I do know that Julie and I just celebrated our 12th wedding anniversary. It&#039;s been a wild, and at times astonishing ride.

So suffice it to say, the subject of relationships is on my mind.

So how does one attract, cultivate, nurture and sustain a relationship that isn&#039;t just healthy and intimate but is in fact extraordinary?

This week&#039;s installment of Ask Me Anything is devoted to just this issue.

This conversation explores:

	the transformational aspects of relationships
	destiny &amp; fate in selecting a mate
	human love versus divine love
	prioritizing self-development
	the primacy of commitment
	the significance of complementary core values
	the power of neutral compassion &amp; observance
	the practice of taking contrary action

Special thanks to Jeremy Bell for this week’s questions and Jason for his fan letter.
The show concludes withI&#039;m Here Now,written and performed by Julie (aka SriMati), accompanied by our sons Tyler &amp; Trapper Piatt.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.
How do you define an extraordinary relationship? Let me know in the comment section below.

"Remember that you cannot control what happens to you. But you can control who you are in the face of what happens to you."

Julie Piatt



I don't how long we've been together -- 17 years? 16? -- but I do know that Julie and I just celebrated our 12th wedding anniversary. It's been a wild, and at times astonishing ride.

So suffice it to say, the subject of relationships is on my mind.

So how does one attract, cultivate, nurture and sustain a relationship that isn't just healthy and intimate but is in fact extraordinary?

This week's installment of Ask Me Anything is devoted to just this issue.

This conversation explores:

	the transformational aspects of relationships
	destiny &amp; fate in selecting a mate
	human love versus divine love
	prioritizing self-development
	the primacy of commitment
	the significance of complementary core values
	the power of neutral compassion &amp; observance
	the practice of taking contrary action

Special thanks to Jeremy Bell for this week’s questions and Jason for his fan letter.
The show concludes withI'm Here Now,written and performed by Julie (aka SriMati), accompanied by our sons Tyler &amp; Trapper Piatt.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.
How do you define an extraordinary relationship? Let me know in the comment section below.

Stephen Ritz



Insurgent educator Stephen Ritz is truly one of the most inspiring game changers I have ever met. A South Bronx elementary school teacher and administrator, he has faced and overcome tremendous bureaucratic, political, and socio-economic odds to catapult generations of young, underprivileged at-risk students to unimaginable academic success and upwardly mobile employment -- all while simultaneously reclaiming and rebuilding the Bronx from the inside out.

The modality leveraged to serve this end? Food. Specifically, growing food.

The personification of triple bottom line values and a staunch advocate of project-based, experiential learning, it all began when Stephen accidentally began growing plants in his classroom. The unexpected result was a level of student engagement even this maverick educator could not have predicted. So what began by fluke soon became Stephen&#039;s passion. It wasn&#039;t long before his Bronx classroom featured the first indoor edible wall in the entire New York City Department of Education -- a wall that routinely generates enough produce to feed healthy meals to 450 students while also training the youngest nationally certified workforce in America.

Stephen&#039;s classroom farm would soon expand, both in the classroom and out, spreading across a community in desperate need for healthy food options. Under his spirited leadership and the tireless efforts of his student and community growers, vacant lots and rooftops across the Bronx -- fairly characterized as an urban food desert -- have been literally transformed, now boasting bountiful gardens that have produced more than 30,000 pounds of vegetables. Food that feeds his students and the greater borough at large.

In the Bronx public school system, student attendance and graduation rates are historically abysmal. But Stephen&#039;s passion and engagement with his students resulted in attendance skyrocketing from a mere 40 percent to 93 percent daily. Not to mention it helped create 2,200 youth jobs. And now he is committed to building the first ever independently financedNational Health, Wellness and Biodiversity Centerin a 100+ year old reclaimed Bronx public school library.

The staggering success of Stephen&#039;s non-traditional teaching methods have captured the world&#039;s attention. His work has been featured in Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, ABC, CNN, NBC, NPR and beyond. Accolades include being one of three Americans named a 2015 Top Ten Finalist for the prestigiousGlobal Teacher Prize-- teaching&#039;s Nobel Prize. He received the United States EPA Award for transforming mindsets and landscapes in New York City. And in 2014 he and his 4th and 5th grade students were invited to, and fêted by, none other than the White House.

After viewing Stephen&#039;s super inspiringTEDxManhattan Talk,ranked in the Top 25 Food / Education TED Talks of all time, I knew I had to have him on the show.



Stephen followed this up with another stunning TEDx Talk:



And if that&#039;s not enough, this beautifulUpworthyshort on Stephen and his work is sure to bring a tear to your eye:



Stephen Ritz is the teacher you wish you had. The teacher every kid deserves. A true paradigm breaker, he sets the pace for future generations of teachers to come. Today we sit down to talk about:

	how he lost over 100 pounds
	a snapshot of life in the Bronx
	the battle to overcome food desert obstacles
	using community to transform communities
	empowering youth via project based learning
	vertical farming &amp; tower garden technology
	the growing locavore movement
	creating garden to café programs
	systematic versus incremental change
	how to be accessible, consistent &amp; present for kids
	why asking for permission is begging for denial, and
	why his mantra is &quot;Si se puede!&quot;

Prepare yourself,</itunes:summary>

I&#039;m hitting a groove.

Although I definitely have some sustainability concerns about posting two weekly editions of the show (have I said how much work this is?), I&#039;m keeping my promise. So here we are again with another installment of Ask Me Anything -- a twist on my typical guest interview format where we answer questions submitted by you, the listener.

But this week it&#039;s a twist on that twist.

In addition to entertaining a few listener inquiries, I gave Julie the latitude to raise a few issues and themes currently on her mind. I think the recipe worked -- it&#039;s quite a revelatory exchange.

This conversation explores:

	Appreciating Diversity Among RRP Guests
	How To Define True Health
	What It Means To Live In Balance
	Eating In Harmony With Nature
	Perspectives On Aging
	Mindful Ruminations on Death
	Cultural Objectification Of Women
	Successful Marriage &amp; Open Communication

The show concludes withMother of Mine,written and performed by Julie (aka SriMati), accompanied by our sons Tyler &amp; Trapper Piatt.

Kristina Carrillo-Bucaram



For most of her young adult life, Kristina Carrillo-Bucaram was in and out of hospitals. Constantly sick, hyperglycemic, low on energy and losing hope that she could ever feel normal.

Little did Kristina know that a chance encounter with a strange man at the grocery store would soon change everything, radically and permanently altering the trajectory of her life.

This week I am delighted to sit down with the effervescent and passionate Fully Raw Kristina -- as she is now popularly known on the internet – to hear all about how a raw vegan diet not only healed her body, but gave her life purpose.

Boasting over 600,000 subscribers, many of you may know Kristina from her wildly popularYouTube Channel.For most, this would be an all consuming full time gig. But making videos is subservient to Kristina&#039;s first passion, which is runningRawfully Organic– the food cooperative she founded in 2007 at age 20. What began in her living room is now the largest raw organic produce co-op in the United States, providing affordable, healthy raw produce to over 6000 members across the Houston area weekly.

Although I would not label myself as fully raw, it&#039;s fair to say that I eat tremendous amounts of raw plant foods every day and can personally attest to the importance of prioritizing a large variety of fresh raw produce on your plate at every meal.

Nonetheless, I can hear you muttering under your breath: eating fully raw sounds so extreme! Is it possible to be healthy, vibrant and happy on raw plant foods alone? Won&#039;t I suffer nutrition deficiencies? To quell these questions, Kristina visited 2-time RRP alumnusGarth Davis, M.D.for a checkup. Here&#039;s how it went down:



Forefront in today&#039;s conversation is of course diet and nutrition. A fun exchange that probes:

	how eating raw resolved Kristina&#039;s hyperglycemia and repaired her health
	the pros &amp; cons of &#039;mono-mealing&#039;
	how cultural traditions can lead us astray
	why fruit is unfairly vilified
	why we should support local, organic farming
	tips &amp; tricks to eating raw economically
	the importance of falling in love with yourself; and
	how to live your truth irrespective of public opinion

Time to step it up.

I am excited to announce that today marks my commitment to henceforth deliver two episodes of the RPP per week. Each week, from today forward I will post the show every Sunday night (as usual) plus every Wednesday night (late night Pacific Standard Time). Like today, sometimes it will be a Q&amp;A episode; other times it will be the typical one-on-one guest format. Perhaps some of them will be topic-specific mini-sodes. Time will tell.
To kick off this new and exciting growth phase, Julie and I are back with another installment of Ask Me Anything -- a twist on my typical format where we answer questions submitted by you, the listener. I absolutely love this format, primarily because it connects me more deeply and authentically with the global community of people who enjoy the show. Because community is truly what it&#039;s all about.
It&#039;s been an exciting time for us. In the last few months we launchedThe Plantpower Wayand have been on the road spreading the word. Recently returned from an incredibly fruitful trip to New York City, Julie and I share a little behind the scenes and catch up on where things are headed with the podcast and our commitment to wellness advocacy.
Then the conversation turns to listener submitted inquiries. A conversation that explores:


	Substance Abuse, Co-Dependency in Relationships
	The ‘Self-Full’ Mandate
	Our perspective on Plant Medicine Ceremonies
	Strategies to Uncover, Address &amp; Conquer Fear
	Connecting With The Authentic Self Within
	Adding Site Resources &amp; Community Forum
	The Importance of Good Deeds

The show concludes withI&#039;m Here Now,written and performed by Julie (aka SriMati), accompanied by our sons Tyler &amp; Trapper Piatt.
Thank you everyone who submitted the 100&#039;s of questions we reviewed. If we didn&#039;t get to yours (obviously chances are we didn&#039;t), don&#039;t be shy &amp; keep them coming. Until we settle on a web-based means of collecting and organizing listener submitted inquiries (if you have ideas on the best way to do this I&#039;m all ears), please send your questions to info@richroll.com and we&#039;ll do our best to answer!

Tucker Max



This week I&#039;m going out on a limb.

When the opportunity arose to sit down with Tucker Max, I admit to a little discomfort and trepidation. On the one, hand, I was genuinely honored he was interested in doing the show. On the other hand, I wasn&#039;t convinced he was the right fit for what I do.

To be sure, Tucker Max is a high performing super-achiever. He is incredibly bright. He is insanely accomplished. And he has millions of fans the world over. Nominated to TIME magazine&#039;s “100 Most Influential List” of 2009, Tucker&#039;s first bookI Hope They Serve Beer in Hellwas a #1 New York Times Bestseller, spent 5 years on the list and ultimately sold over 2 million copies. He followed it up with two more books, both of which were also New York Times Bestsellers. Perhaps most impressive? Tucker is one of only three writers -- along with Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis -- to ever have three books on the New York Times Non-Fiction Bestseller List at the same time.

Tucker Max is a publishing juggernaut. 

Irrespective of whatever opinion you may hold about the content of those books, you cannot deny that is a towering achievement.

However, it&#039;s these very books, the fratire genre he singlehandedly birthed, and Tucker’s very public persona as America’s foremost bro -- well known for his healthy ego, brash opinions and candid chronicling of his outlandish partying exploits – that gave me considered pause.

Do I really want to talk to a guy who wrote a book calledAssholes Finish First?It’s just not my scene. It&#039;s not what I’m about. I don’t support those ideas. I&#039;m not interested in that guy. It’s not me. 

But what is interesting, and why I ultimately decided to go forward with this interview, is that&#039;s not Tucker either. At least not any more.

The Tucker Max of today is not the same hard drinking, hard partying, womanizing Tucker Max that made him famous and rich.

In the wake of his staggering success, Tucker woke up to realize that all the material benefits he worked so hard to attain just weren&#039;t quite all they were cracked up to be. None of it made him happy.

So what then? Ego must submit to introspection. Entering a period of honest self-reflection, Tucker took inventory of his life. He underwent psychological analysis. He asked himself the hard questions. What is truly important?

In a word, Tucker Max grew up.

Emerging from that former guy far more self-actualized, Tucker is telling a new story. Retired from fratire writing and the partying lifestyle, Tucker is now happily married (yes, monogamous) with Bishop, his newborn son. Today he is an angel investor and start up entrepreneur with a successful and exciting new venture designed to democratize publishing calledBook In A Box.He co-founded and co-hostsThe Mating Grounds,a popular podcast designed to help men have successful relationships with women. And September marks the release of his new bookMate,focused on helping men find Miss Right not by being assholes, but by becoming the best version of themselves.

Trust me, the irony of this arc is hardly lost on Tucker.

Here’s the deal. If this podcast is about anything, it’s about transformation. Getting honest with yourself and owning your truth. It&#039;s about evolving. Overcoming negative habits. Letting go of things that no longer serve you.

It&#039;s about growth. 

I was keen to explore these themes with Tucker. I really wanted to know why he decided to change. What prompted it and how he did it. I wanted to know how he currently perceives his past; and what he’s interested in now. Most all, I wanted to know what can be mined from his experience that can be of benefit for all of us.

Don’t get me wrong. Tucker is still Tucker. Dynamic, charismatic, razor sharp, opinionated, unapologetic and at times characteristically ribald.</itunes:summary>

Tucker Max



This week I'm going out on a limb.

When the opportunity arose to sit down with Tucker Max, I admit to a little discomfort and trepidation. On the one, hand, I was genuinely honored he was interested in doing the show. On the other hand, I wasn't convinced he was the right fit for what I do.

Don’t get me wrong. Tucker is still Tucker. Dynamic, charismatic, razor sharp, opinionated, unapologetic and at times characteristically ribald. But I also found him to be highly engaging; poised and pleasantly introspective.

This is a conversation that explores:

	law school &amp; law firm truths
	what it's like to be successful yet unfulfilled
	alcoholism – addiction or disease?
	the benefits of psychoanalysis
	the importance of meditation
	finding your emotional truth
	the power of storytelling
	the trauma of parental narcissism 
	navigating anger issues
	pair bonding
	why publishing needs a reboot

Quick note: there are a few instances of explicit language and a couple off color stories. But hey, its Tucker Max. It goes with the territory. So maybe pop in the earbuds if you're at work or driving around with the kiddos.

In all honesty, I really enjoyed this conversation. We had a great time. I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange &amp; look forward to your thoughts in the comments section below.

Darin Olien



What&#039;s it like to traipse the far outreaches of the globe in search of the the world’s greatest edible food sources for optimal health?

Meet the Indiana Jones of Superfoods.

This week my friend Darin Olien joins me to share insights and wisdom from his extraordinary adventure-based experiences as a widely recognized exotic superfoods hunter, wellness advocate &amp; environmental activist.

Darin&#039;s passion was seeded early. Attending his father’s lectures on agricultural business at the University of Minnesota birthed an early appreciation of whole food nutrition. But it wasn&#039;t until a football injury sidelined a frustrated young Darin that his curiosity in the relationship between food and health begin to truly take root. A curiosity that began with a simple question:

There must be a better way to heal myself.

The intrigue that evolved from that initial query has been an ongoing, twenty-year plus quest for better, more natural pathways to ultimate wellness. A journey that led Darin to study exotic, indigenous herbs and superfoods from every imaginable port of call across the developing world. Communing with thousands of rural farmers, growers and manufacturers in remote communities across Peru, Bhutan, the Amazon, the Himalayas, the South Pacific, Latin America and Asia, Darin now shepherds high-quality, fair-trade superfoods and herbal commodities to market through his company, Darin’s Naturals.

Perhaps best known for his work with fitness company Beachbody, Darin was instrumental in the development and ongoing formulation of the wildly successful whole-food supplement,Shakeology.He chronicles his experience in his new bookSuperlife: The 5 Forces That Will Make You healthy, Fit &amp; Eternally Awesome– as well as on his website Superlife.com– where he demystifies health, fitness, nutrition, and longevity into simple daily actions designed to promote life-long wellness.

What is most intriguing to me isn’t just that Darin is a respected authority on the healing potential of food. And it isn&#039;t just that he has been instrumental in introducing these so called superfoods to western consumers. What is most interesting is his commitment to do it right. A deep rooted responsibility to fairly, sustainably and transparently support the grower communities and their long-term interests.

Ripped and Malibu sun kissed, Darin more than resembles a plant-based version of his friend and workout buddy Laird Hamilton. So it would be natural to presume he has always been a model of health and fitness. But that presumption would be misplaced. Because for Darin it wasn&#039;t always this way. Like all of us, Darin has faced many challenging and relatable life obstacles on his path to living what I think is fair to characterize as his best, most authentic superlife.

At the same time, the term superfoods is prone to cavalier overuse. Are these foods truly &quot;super&quot; or is it all just exaggerated marketing hype?

This is a conversation that explores that issue and so much more.

I sincerely hope you enjoy this exchange with a man who exudes positive energy, passion and enthusiasm for health. I look forward to your thoughts in the comments section below.

Josh LaJaunie



Josh LaJaunie is perhaps the most inspirational everyman example of healthy, transformative living I have ever met.

After 151 episodes of the podcast, our first initial conversation back in December of 2013(RRP 63)is to this day one of the most popular, most downloaded episodes in the history of the show. If you missed it, please make a point of listening to this amazing exchangehere.

That conversation transpired on Skype. We had never actually met. Now we have. AtHealthfestin Marshall, TX a few months back I had the opportunity to spend an entire weekend with Josh. It was a memorable experience that left me more impressed than ever with this fine young man. Not just because he has overcome tremendous obstacles to restore and maintain his health. Not just because he continues to impressively evolve as an athlete and runner. But because of the exemplary human being he has become. A big spirit who continues to grow. A giant heart and shining example of service -- constantly educating and inspiring his loved ones and community at large.

The story -- as laid out in his self-penned manifesto&quot;Free Josh LaJaunie&quot;-- goes like this:

In November of 2013, this guy I had never heard of called Josh LaJaunie tweeted me his before and after pictures. The change was so astonishing, my first thought was, can this be real? The 400+ pound guy on the left bore almost no resemblance to the guy on the right, a super fit, handsome young man running with a big smile on his face.

Chris Farley had morphed into Bradley Cooper. But how?

On a lark, I invited him on the podcast. I had no idea his story -- more importantly his ability to own and tell his story -- would be so extraordinary. The experience left me and everyone who tuned in indelibly changed. Ever since, I have felt inexplicably bonded to a guy I never actually met.

In short, Josh accomplished what some would deem impossible, dropping over 200 pounds and a life-long addiction to unhealthy foods &amp; lifestyle habits to discover a passion for running. A journey that led him to completing multiple marathons and more recently his first ultramarathon. He didn&#039;t just lose weight. And he didn&#039;t just keep the weight off. He became an athlete.

A real athlete.

Most impressive is how he faced, battled and overcame astounding, impossibly entrenched cultural obstacles to change everything about how he lives his life. A gift he now freely and quite joyously shares, permanently transforming the lives of everyone who crosses his path.



Born &amp; bred in southern Louisiana, Josh is a 100% genuine, authentic, self-avowed &quot;swamp dweller&quot; from Bayou Lafourche. A big kid with an even bigger heart surrounded by a loving nuclear and extended family united by their shared adoration of food. Josh was a standout high school football player, recruited to play college ball. But disillusioned by college life in Arkansas, he dropped out of school, only to return home, aimless and unmoored. He found work in the family construction business, but lived for the weekend - time spent hunting, fishing, cheering for his beloved New Orleans Saints, feasting on his favorite local delicacies -- po boys, jambalaya &amp; barbeque. And partying. Lots of partying. It&#039;s just what you do down in Bayou Lafourche.

The weight escalated.  As did the despair.  His embarrassment and shame escalating in equal measure to his declining self-esteem and overall well being.

Then something happened.  In 2010, Josh&#039;s beloved Saints achieved the impossible, winning the Super Bowl. It seems a small thing. But to Josh it was everything. Forever altering his perception of what is possible, he began to question the limits he imposed upon himself. Empowered, he began to &quot;let go of his normal&quot; and dismiss the embedded &quot;that&#039;s just t</itunes:summary>

A real athlete.

Born &amp; bred in southern Louisiana, Josh is a 100% genuine, authentic, self-avowed "swamp dweller" from Bayou Lafourche.

Josh was a standout high school football player, recruited to play college ball. But disillusioned by college life in Arkansas, he dropped out of school, only to return home, aimless and unmoored. He found work in the family construction business, but lived for the weekend - time spent hunting, fishing, cheering for his beloved New Orleans Saints, feasting on his favorite local delicacies -- po boys, jambalaya &amp; barbeque. And partying. Lots of partying. It's just what you do down in Bayou Lafourche.

The weight escalated.  As did the despair.  His embarrassment and shame escalating in equal measure to his declining self-esteem and overall well being.

Then something happened.  In 2010, Josh's beloved Saints achieved the impossible, winning the Super Bowl. It seems a small thing. But to Josh it was everything. Forever altering his perception of what is possible, he began to question the limits he imposed upon himself. Empowered, he began to "let go of his normal" and dismiss the embedded "that's just the way it is down here" mentality he was starting to understand often taints the logic of his region.

A chain reaction of events ensued that set Josh on a new trajectory. A path that involved a return to fitness and the adoption of a 100% plant-based diet. A path that changed everything about his life in impossibly unpredictable ways.



It's one thing to "go vegan" in Santa Monica, California. But it's another thing entirely in Thibodaux, Louisiana. No plant-friendly restaurants. No Whole Foods Market. Essentially zero community support. An environment where unhealthy food isn't just a choice, but a celebrated cultural imperative. Some might even say a religion.

That Josh cut against the grain is an understatement. To embrace the plant-based lifestyle didn't just mean an open invitation to ridicule. It meant risking complete social ostracization.

I am proud to once again give Josh a well-deserved microphone to share his powerful, continually evolving story. But I am more proud to call him a friend.



I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation, which picks up where we last left off. A conversation certain to erase whatever obstacles and excuses you rely on that perpetuate bad habits, keep you stuck, and reinforce denial. A conversation that explores:

	Creating a Mindset to Make the Impossible Possible
	Combating Self-Deprecation to Confidence
	The Preeminence of Mental, Emotional &amp; Spiritual Growth
	Overcoming Unhealthy Food Culture
	Setting Goals and Seeing Them To Fruition
	Plant-based/Weight Loss Journey With Familial Support
	Marathon Training and Logistics
	Positive Dynamic Shifts During Crisis
	Encouragement in Marriage
	Service/Ambassador of Health
	Natural Progression/Serendipity
	The Importance of Self Love

By listening, my hope is that you will realize that no matter what your circumstances or environment, we all have the power to implement profound personal change beyond our collective imagination in miraculous and fantastic ways.

You're a good man Josh LaJaunie.

WuDe



Today my friend WuDe returns to the show to drop some mad Zen Buddhist wisdom.

In case you missed it, I strongly encourage you to dial up our first conversation.RRP #87: Art &amp; The Importance of Living Teais a fascinating deep dive into the world, history, and ancient teachings of tea as a means to glean broader truths about health, healing, community, the environment, and oneness – the universal interconnectedness of everything.

During that initial conversation, we barely scratched the surface with respect to the extensive knowledge and wisdom brimming from WuDe&#039;s soul. So when he returned for recent visit to Los Angeles, I jumped on the chance to have him back on the show. A rare opportunity to more fully mine the philosophy and the traditions of Zen Buddhism to help us better navigate our modern lives.

Born in the United States as Aaron Daniel Fisher, Wude was drawn to the East from a very early age. After studying philosophy in college, he traveled the world and ultimately settled in Taiwan, where he has since become a Buddhist monk. A tea master. And the founder ofGlobal Tea Hut-- a school and center that harvests tea, educates all comers on the traditions surrounding tea, and welcomes people from all over the world to study the Dao of Tea as a method of spiritual cultivation.

I said it in reference to our first conversation. I&#039;ll say it again.

This just might be the most fascinating and soul expanding conversation you will hear all week.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

Garth Davis, MD



This week marks the return of Garth Davis, MD -- a veteran weight loss surgeon who took it upon himself to determine exactly why so many people are plagued by obesity. A quest that led him down a deep research hole to identify the ultimate human diet to maximize and maintain weight loss; optimize human health; and prevent (and even reverse) lifestyle disease -- both for himself and his patients (tune in toRRP 50for our first conversation).

About 7 years ago, the good doctor became his own patient. At the time, he was suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure and a fatty liver. In other words, he was downright sick; headed towards a future plagued by obesity and chronic illness. Ironic, yes. But not surprising given the demanding hours of the surgeon lifestyle, lack of exercise, a preference for salty, fatty foods, and the convenience of fast food options in the hospital cafeteria. In fact, there was a Wendy&#039;s in the University of Michigan hospital where Garth did his internship and residency, resulting in a daily dose of  double cheeseburgers -- a habit he maintained for years.

Let&#039;s just say I can relate.

Current conventional wisdom in his field is that overweight patients should adopt a very low carb, low to no fruit, high protein diet -- hop on board the ketosis bandwagon. Like many, and without inquiring further, Garth simply bought into this idea as truth. He even wrote a book in 2007 advocating this approach to food, called The Experts Guide To Weight Loss Surgery.

The only problem? This approach to diet failed him and many other friends, colleagues and patients. He knew there had to be a better solution. And his patients needed help beyond knee-jerk surgery. Finally ready for a personal change, he took it upon himself to research -- truly research -- nutrition for the first time.

His study became an obsession. The more he delved into the peer reviewed work, the more convinced he became that there is absolutely no legitimate science to back the long-term health claims surrounding the strongly held belief that if we want to be thin and healthy we should eat a high protein low carbohydrate diet.

What did he find? If we want to prevent obesity and disease; attain and maintain ideal weight management; and achieve true optimal health and long-term wellness, we need to embrace our inner herbivore.

Sound far-fetched? Before you balk, understand that (much like me) adopting a plant-based lifestyle absolutely revolutionized Garth&#039;s health beyond what he could have imagined. Not only did he drop the weight that plagued him for years, all of his blood markers suddenly and quite magically normalized. His allergies vanished. His sleep improved, his energy levels skyrocketed and he got off his statin medications. In short, he finally began to walk his talk. As his life began to turn around, he wanted to be an example to his patients. For the first time in his life, he began exercising.

Then he did the extraordinary. Despite never having been an athlete, in 2011 he completed Ironman Texas in 12 hours and 6 minutes.

His personal results nothing short of extraordinary, Garth has become a crusader intent on teaching people real nutrition. I encourage you to peruse hisFacebook pagefor a litany of highly entertaining and informative rants on how the internet pseudo-experts are manipulating the science to push high protein diet and how to parse fact from fiction in the scientific literature. Come October, you can get the full unabridged Garth in his new book,Proteinaholic: How Our Obsession With Meat Is Killing Us and What We Can Do About It.

“...that’s what medical school does – it teaches you to treat symptoms; it doesn’t teach you to treat a larger cause; it doesn’t teach food as medicine.”

But not surprising given the demanding hours of the surgeon lifestyle, lack of exercise, a preference for salty, fatty foods, and the convenience of fast food options in the hospital cafeteria. In fact, there was a Wendy's in the University of Michigan hospital where Garth did his internship and residency, resulting in a daily dose of  double cheeseburgers -- a habit he maintained for years.

Let's just say I can relate.

Current conventional wisdom in his field is that overweight patients should adopt a very low carb, low to no fruit, high protein diet -- hop on board the ketosis bandwagon.

Let's face it. Most doctors are kind of boring. What really distinguishes Garth from the fray is his acute talent for effectively communicating his knowledge with passion and charisma in a way that catalyzes positive long lasting change -- and that my friends is rare.

This is an in depth exploration of all the questions that profoundly confuse the mainstream. Subjects I get asked about everyday, such as:

	the scientific truth behind low carb, high fat diets;
	the health implications of the ketosis lifestyle;
	the pitfalls of reductionist food science;
	the impact of politicized regulatory bodies and lobbyists on medicine;
	the nutritional benefits of a plant-based lifestyle;
	the relationship between meat intake and diabetes
	what's the deal with gluten? (his opinion on this might surprise you);
	plant-based versus paleo;
	the relationship between saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, heart disease and diabetes; and of course
	the differences between animal and plant protein and the impact on muscle protein synthesis

Dr. Davis is nothing if not outspoken. His position is unequivocal.

Bottom line? I wanted this show to be the one podcast that would cut through the morass of confusion and hype surrounding popular diet trends and set the record (and my perspective) straight. Let's just say Dr. Garth delivers, and then some.

This is one for the ages. I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

		<itunes:summary>“You can set as many goals as you want. But without belief and conviction, it won’t happen.”

James &quot;Iron Cowboy&quot; Lawrence



UPDATE: July 26, 2015. He did it. Yesterday I had the great honor and privilege of running the final marathon with James, and watching him cross the finish line on his 50th ironman in 50 states in 50 days to the deafening cheers of over 1,000 fans in attendance. What James has accomplished isn&#039;t just stunning -- it&#039;s truly one of the greatest achievements in the history of (voluntary) human endurance. We made plans to do a follow up podcast today, but alas he lost his voice taking the time to talk to all his fans late into the evening last night. However, I promise we will reconvene very soon so I can bring you the full story, pillar to post. Until then, please enjoy this prefatory conversation.

People roll their eyes in incredulity when I tell them about my experience completing 5 ironman-distance triathlons on five Hawaiian Islands in under a week. If you are one of those people, brace yourself. This week&#039;s guest will blow the lid off everything you thought you knew about human potential. The capacity to suffer. And the will to endure.



James Lawrence -- aka the Iron Cowboy -- is a husband. A proud father of five kids. And an athlete with two Guinness World Records in triathlon: most 70.3 races in a calendar year (22 in 30 weeks) and most Ironman triathlons in a calendar year (30).

Nonetheless, James is restless. He knows he is capable of so much more.

So just two weeks from today, on June 6, 2015 the Iron Cowboy will strive for the seemingly impossible when he attempts a challenge so mind numbing I get delirious just thinking about it:

50 Ironman courses, 50 consecutive days, through all 50 States.



You read it correctly. James&#039; impending adventure is literally 10x the magnitude and degree of difficulty of anything I have personally experienced -- a challenge that will test James&#039; mind, body and soul beyond anything I can personally fathom.

The best part?He is inviting everyone to join with him.

This week I sit down with James to sort it all out:




	what inspired his lunatic fringe;
	how he is preparing physically, mentally, emotionally;
	the &quot;whys&quot; behind the hows and whats;
	how he balances his training and racing with professional &amp; family life

I found James to be surprisingly grounded; extremely gracious; and quite large at heart. But if I am being completely honest, I have serious doubts about the plausibility of him succeeding in his 50/50/50 quest. I have no doubt James can do 50 Ironman-distance triathlons in 50 states.  It&#039;s the 50 days part that gets me. Because it leaves absolutely zero room for error. None. And if there is one thing I know about adventures of this ilk, error is an indispensable part if the equation. It&#039;s not if something will go wrong. The question is when.

Please don&#039;t misunderstand. I&#039;m a fan. James is one of the good guys. Someone easy to pull for. I want to see him succeed and you will too. So let&#039;s get behind James and his extraordinary goal. Check out hiswebsite.Consider throwing him a donation on Indiegogo.Toss some love his way onTwitterandInstagram.Peruse hisscheduleand if/when he passes through your locale this summer, make a point to go out and log a few miles with him.

Together we can put some much needed wind in his sails. And more often than not it&#039;s that little extra boost that marks the difference between achieving the impossible and giving up altogether.

I appreciate James sharing his story with me. I look forward to cheering him on as this adventure unfolds and I sincerely hope you do too. Enjoy the conversation.

Daniel Pinchbeck



Philosopher. Author. Futurist. Counter culture provocateur.

Described as a mashup of James Merrill, H. P. Lovecraft, and Carlos Castaneda, I was first introduced to Daniel Pinchbeck through his rather fascinating metaphysical study of prophesy in2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl-- a book that explored humanity&#039;s precarious balance between greater self-potential and environmental disaster.

Raised by Beat generation parents -- his mother dated Jack Kerouac around the time On The Road exploded on the scene -- Daniel’s roots in the New York counterculture movement run deep. Throughout the 1990s, Pinchbeck matured into a member of New York&#039;s literary select. He wrote for publications such as The New York Times Magazine, Esquire, Rolling Stone and Harper&#039;s Bazaar.

But slowly something happened. As he approached his late twenties, he describes falling into a deep spiritual crisis fueled by a frustration with the inherent shortcomings of mainstream media and a friend&#039;s sudden passing due to a heroin overdose. Despair ultimately led him to an investigation of shamanism. Embracing metaphysical belief systems, his psyche and body began to open to the mystical. His first book,Breaking Open the Head,chronicled these experiences and observations from a first hand perspective and was heralded as the most significant on psychedelic experimentation since the work of Terence McKenna.



Today, everything Mayan, shamanistic and post-modern psychedelia seems to always point to this uniquely perspicacious, probing mind. And I think it&#039;s fair to say that Daniel is considered a leading pioneer of the post-modern psychedelic movement, advocating a measured, responsible exploration of shamanistic cultural rites and the substances they employ to expand consciousness.

If Daniel is anything, he is a maverick, persistently challenging social, political, economic and cultural paradigms. A man searching for answers both personal and global, his insights are both provocative and fascinating, and more often than not imbued with hope for a better (if not idealized) future world.

A confession: Daniel has a prodigious intellect. I admit to being a bit intimidated. Moreover, I have no experience with psychedelics, and as a sober person in recovery it is unlikely I ever will. So I was unsure as to whether interviewing him would be a good idea or even appropriate for this show. But the opportunity arose and I couldn&#039;t imagine passing it up.

I’m glad I didn’t. Much like my recent conversation withTom Hardin,this episode marks a departure into new terrain for me. On a personal level, I found Daniel to be engaging, introspective and not surprisingly possessed with the rare ability to muse on a vastly diverse array of challenging themes.

This is a fascinating -- albeit at times challenging -- mind-bender deep dive into Daniel&#039;s paradigm breaking vision that explores:

	the raising of global consciousness; 
	the imperative for community building;
	the importance of rites of passage to transcend ego;
	the idea of humanity as super-organism;
	the implications of technology, capitalism and modern consumerist behavior; and 
	the mandate for new economic, environmental and thought paradigms.

So let&#039;s take a trip down the rabbit hole through the looking glass that is the consciousness of Daniel Pinchbeck.

I genuinely hope you enjoy this conversation and look forward to your thoughts in the comments section below.

“Electronic culture created soulless replacements for connective rituals -- television supplanted tribal legends told by the fire; ‘fast food’ consumed in distraction took the place of a shared meal. We substituted matter for Mater (feminine principle), money for mother’s milk, objects for emotional bonds.”

Daniel Pinchbeck



Philosopher. Author. Futurist. Counter culture provocateur.

Described as a mashup of James Merrill, H. P. Lovecraft, and Carlos Castaneda, I was first introduced to Daniel Pinchbeck through his rather fascinating metaphysical study of prophesy in2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl-- a book that explored humanity's precarious balance between greater self-potential and environmental disaster.

Raised by Beat generation parents -- his mother dated Jack Kerouac around the time On The Road exploded on the scene -- Daniel’s roots in the New York counterculture movement run deep. Throughout the 1990s, Pinchbeck matured into a member of New York's literary select. He wrote for publications such as The New York Times Magazine, Esquire, Rolling Stone and Harper's Bazaar.

Landon Cassill



It&#039;s time to explore what it takes to be competitive in one of the most popular professional sports in the United States -- NASCAR.

Meet Landon Cassill.

Driver. Triathlete. Husband. Plant-based.

Racing as far back as he can remember, at just 19 years of age Landon burst onto the national scene as the 2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series Rookie of the Year. In 2013, he broke the track record at the famous Gresham Motorsports Park track. Now 25, Landon pilots the #40 Chevrolet SS for the Hillman-Circle Sport LLC team and the #01 Flex Seal Chevrolet for JDMotorsports in the NASCAR Nationwide Series.

Beyond Will Ferrell&#039;s turn in Talledega Nights, NASCAR (make that auto racing in general) is a world I know close to nothing about. So it was really fun to sit down with Charlotte-based Landon to explore his personal story; the very specific and peculiar culture of NASCAR; what it really takes to professionally toe the line at prestigious races like theDaytona 500;and how diet and triathlon have come to play a crucial role in Landon’s daily success equation.

Extremely likable and humble beyond expectation, I think it&#039;s fair to say this Iowa-bred young man is a fine living example of solid midwestern values and what can transpire when lifelong passion meets true drive, keen focus and a Malcolm Gladwell-esque 10,000+ hours of very hard work, sweat and determination.

This is a great conversation that explores:

	the athleticism, skill, technology and funding required to excel as a professional driver;
	myth &amp; reality behind NASCAR stereotypes;
	the nexus between mindfulness and driving;
	how triathlon informs driving performance;
	swim training with Olympians Ryan Lochte, Cullen Jones &amp; Tyler Clary;
	his decision to go plant-based;
	plant-based fueling for athletic performance;
	strategies for optimal nutrition when traveling; and
	what he drives when not racing (the answer will surprise you)

On May 24, Landon will be racing theCoca-Cola 600at Charlotte Motor Speedway. After competing in NASCAR&#039;s longest and most challenging test of man and machine, Landon will pioneer an entirely new form of endurance multi-sport when he jumps out of his car post-race, laces up his running shoes and tacks on an additional 14 miles for the day with a run from Charlotte Motor Speedway to the NASCAR Hall of Fame. The Cassil 614 will kick offSnap Fitness’s “Snap Serves” summer campaign,which honors those who have served in the military and encourages people around the country to start their fitness journey.



Between now and Landon&#039;s big day, do me a solid and let&#039;s pump him up for this challenge by giving him a supportive shout out on Twitter at@landoncassill.

I genuinely hope you enjoy this glimpse into the passionate life of Landon Cassill -- my version of Talledega Nights.

Tom Hardin



This week we explore some very new terrain.

Let&#039;s kick it off with the Greek myth of Icarus.

As the story goes, Daedalus -- a master craftsman best known for building King Minos&#039; labyrinth to trap the Minotaur -- plied his talent to construct a pair of wax and feather wings to help him and his son Icarus escape from Minos&#039; vendetta (it&#039;s a long story) and Crete altogether.

Being the good father he was, Daedalus pled with his son not to fly too close to the sun for fear that the heat would melt the wings. But as sons are wont to do, Icarus ignored his father’s advice.

The rest is history. The heat indeed melted Icarus&#039; wings, sending him into a deathly free fall collision with the sea which today bears his name, the Ikarian Sea near Ikaria -- ironically one of the Blue Zones as described inmy recent podcast conversation with Dan Buettner.

As most know, this is an age-old remonstration about ambition. A tragic allegory about the perils of hubris, particularly when fueled by a sense of entitlement, and perhaps sprinkled with a light dusting of denial.

These are all very human traits of course. And if today&#039;s guest is anything, he is quite human indeed.

Tom Hardin was a highly motivated young guy with a big bright future and Wall Street aspirations. After graduating from the prestigious Wharton School of Business, he was on track to achieve his dream when he landed in the fast paced hedge fund world and quickly rose through the ranks.

But it wasn’t long before Tom felt he was falling behind – lacking that mysterious competitive ‘edge’ so many others seemed to freely enjoy (without repercussion) to their reward in untold millions.

What was that edge? If you ask Tom, he will tell you the not so secret to success within the insular hedge fund world meant having a network of inside sources willing to share reliable confidential information about companies they worked for or with.

Everybody&#039;s doing it. Nobody&#039;s getting caught. I&#039;m falling behind.

Then one day Tom got a call from an investor colleague namedRoomy Khan– a woman with some pretty juicy insider tips.

The timing was right. Tom was primed. And that fateful moment arose. That moment when you make a decision to take a very small step over a very important line. A decision you simply cannot undo. Not now, not ever.

For Tom, it started with taking a few small crumbs off the table. An imperceptible insider trade here, another one there. Until one day, the previously unthinkable became easy. Almost too easy.

Capitalizing on a handful of secrets fed by Khan and others about companies like Google, 3Com and Hilton Hotels, Tom&#039;s flight towards the sun escalated to the tune of $1.7 million in gains for his fund and $46K in personal profits.

Then in July 2008, while dropping of his dry cleaning one morning, Tom felt a tap on the shoulder. A tap that would alter the trajectory of his life forever.

Like a scene out of a movie, Tom turned to face two FBI agents boxing him in with with a Hobson&#039;s choice – either get in the back of the black sedan for a trip downtown, or start providing actionable information on those higher up the food chain.

“I am my own undoing. But there have been many positives to come out of it.”

Tom Hardin



This week we explore some very new terrain.

Let's kick it off with the Greek myth of Icarus.

As the story goes, Daedalus -- a master craftsman best known for building King Minos' labyrinth to trap the Minotaur -- plied his talent to construct a pair of wax and feather wings to help him and his son Icarus escape from Minos' vendetta (it's a long story) and Crete altogether.

Being the good father he was, Daedalus pled with his son not to fly too close to the sun for fear that the heat would melt the wings. But as sons are wont to do, Icarus ignored his father’s advice.

The rest is history. The heat indeed melted Icarus' wings, sending him into a deathly free fall collision with the sea which today bears his name, the Ikarian Sea near Ikaria -- ironically one of the Blue Zones as described inmy recent podcast conversation with Dan Buettner.

As most know, this is an age-old remonstration about ambition. A tragic allegory about the perils of hubris, particularly when fueled by a sense of entitlement, and perhaps sprinkled with a light dusting of denial.

These are all very human traits of course. And if today's guest is anything, he is quite human indeed.

Tom Hardin was a highly motivated young guy with a big bright future and Wall Street aspirations. After graduating from the prestigious Wharton School of Business, he was on track to achieve his dream when he landed in the fast paced hedge fund world and quickly rose through the ranks.

But it wasn’t long before Tom felt he was falling behind – lacking that mysterious competitive ‘edge’ so many others seemed to freely enjoy (without repercussion) to their reward in untold millions.

What was that edge? If you ask Tom, he will tell you the not so secret to success within the insular hedge fund world meant having a network of inside sources willing to share reliable confidential information about companies they worked for or with.

Everybody's doing it. Nobody's getting caught. I'm falling behind.

Then one day Tom got a call from an investor colleague namedRoomy Khan– a woman with some pretty juicy insider tips.

The timing was right. Tom was primed. And that fateful moment arose. That moment when you make a decision to take a very small step over a very important line. A decision you simply cannot undo. Not now, not ever.

For Tom, it started with taking a few small crumbs off the table. An imperceptible insider trade here, another one there. Until one day, the previously unthinkable became easy. Almost too easy.

Capitalizing on a handful of secrets fed by Khan and others about companies like Google, 3Com and Hilton Hotels, Tom's flight towards the sun escalated to the tune of $1.7 million in gains for his fund and $46K in personal profits.

Then in July 2008, while dropping of his dry cleaning one morning, Tom felt a tap on the shoulder. A tap that would alter the trajectory of his life forever.

Like a scene out of a movie, Tom turned to face two FBI agents boxing him in with with a Hobson's choice – either get in the back of the black sedan for a trip downtown, or start providing actionable information on those higher up the food chain.

Panicked and heart pounding, he immediately opted for the latter.

Ultimately, Tom became one of the most prolific informants in securities fraud history. Soon infamous as the mysterious, unnamed Tipper X, Tom spent the next several years wiretapping and documenting the illegal misdeeds of friends and colleagues as an instrumental, key figure in what the FBI deemed "Operation Perfect Hedge" -- a Wall Street house-cleaning campaign that matured into the biggest insider trading case of this generation.


When the dust settled, Tom's cooperation led to over two dozen convictions, most notably the toppling of billionaire and Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam, who was accused of making $75 million personally and is now serving an 11-year prison term.

Due to his extraordinary cooperation, Tom avoided jail time, but did not escape the scarlet 5-letter word: felon.

Although his wife and family stood steadfast, Tom lost his job, his friends, his standing in the community, his dream, his sense of self and what his life was supposed to be. His relationship with sanity started to slip. With right and wrong confused, heavy bouts with depression ensued. His spirit sank in proportion to his expanding waistline.

Today he finds himself unemployable. Racked by guilt. Afraid. And, it can be fairly said, quite alone.

I am my own undoing.

Our culture thrives on schadenfreude. But it’s easy to judge when we're watching comfortably from the sidelines. Whether it’s a professional cyclist's decision to dope or a trader's choice to barter on insider information, we all think we would make a different decision. I know I do.

But I also know that unless I have walked a mile in someone else's shoes, it's not my place to say with any degree of certainty what I would have done under similar circumstances.

But that's not really the question I am interested in. From my perspective, it's far more interesting to explore:

	the factors that lead a person towards their own dismantling;
	the emotional landscape that accompanies such a scenario;
	what can be learned from Tom’s experience; and
	the inherent power of moments like these to become reborn

Tragedy can be recast as divine. Not just as an opportunity for a second chance, but as a true gift -- a brief moment in which the door cracks open, the light shines in and the stars align to provide a rare opportunity to harness the painful past; learn something crucial about yourself; set a new trajectory; and ultimately transform everything about who you are to become an entirely different and better person altogether.

I won't say Tom is there yet. He remains unclear on where his life might lead. But his journey has begun -- a soulful exploration and search for answers he is slowly beginning to discover through community service; a newly discovered love of ultrarunning; and his simple willingness to entrust me with his story.

I am honored that Tom agreed to sit down with me in March (just weeks after his sentencing hearing) to share -- for the very first time on record -- the details behind the choices he has made, the wreckage it has caused and what he has learned about himself in the process.

Snitch? Hero?

Maybe both. Maybe neither. Maybe more complicated than that. Probably.

Whatever your take, I applaud the courage it took to engage me in this conversation. Candor, vulnerability and raw honesty are hard to come by, and Tom demonstrates it today in spades. I’m proud to share this exchange and my hope is that you find something compelling about the human condition that will better inform your own path.

I genuinely hope you enjoy the conversation and look forward to your thoughts in the comments section below.

Timothy Shieff



When the question turns to living your truth, this first line from Timothy Shieff&#039;sself-authored biosays it all:

I&#039;m a Human practicing Being.

Widely considered one of the world’s best Freerunners (more commonly referred to as parkour), Timothy -- aka Livewire -- specializes in a death and gravity defying skill set that leaves mere mortals agape. Scaling buildings and leaping off rooftops with effortless grace, Tim is a perfect physical manifestation of focus, coordination, strength, agility and fearlessness.



Indeed, this proper and polite young English lad can do things you can’t. And yet his expression is fueled not by competitive drive, but by something deeper. Tim&#039;s particular brand of parkour is subversive. Reframing the inanimate building, rooftop, curb or railing, Tim inverts the human relationship between human and object. Truly a social and political performance artist, Tim leaves me inspired to live more harmoniously with our ever-changing environment.

Despite captaining Team Europe to a world championship onAmerican Ninja Warrior(and setting records along the way), Tim&#039;s athleticism runs a distant second to his passion for advocacy. A powerful young voice in the vegan movement, Tim wakes up every morning enthusiastic to not only expand his own horizons, but inspire others to do the same.



But more than any of this, it&#039;s Tim&#039;s spirit that moves me, and why I&#039;m so proud to introduce his return to the RRP. In case you missed it, be sure to check out my first conversation with Tim --RRP #86.

Intelligent and articulate beyond his years, my hope is that this conversation leaves you with a new mindfulness and perspective on your path and priorities; pondering the impact of our consumer choices on the planet; and questioning culturally entrenched assumptions about the relationship between nutrition and extraordinary athletic performance.

I genuinely hope you enjoy the conversation.

Peace + Plants,



P.S. - Tim recently completed his first 26.2 at the London Marathon in 3:04. Not a bad debut for a guy who just started running!

Casey Neistat



This week marks the return of my friend Casey Neistat to the podcast.

Where to even begin...

As a filmmaker credentialed with co-creating an HBO series and laurels from prestigious outlets like Cannes, Sundance and the Independent Spirit Awards, one would expect an artist of his pedigree to be directing feature films, documentaries and television shows for mainstream media. And yet sometime around 2010, Casey opted for the road less travelled, putting the traditional filmmaker path in his rearview to blaze a different and quite surprising path more in alignment with his DIY sensibilities:

YouTube.

The great irony is that in embracing the most democratic of platforms as his primary artistic outlet, Casey has indeed become one of the most compelling and culturally relevant voices of his generation.

From his sensational &quot;Make It Count&quot; (my fave) to his poignant &quot;What Would You Do with $25,000?&quot; to his gleeful &quot;Snowboard NYC&quot;, Casey has logged over 129 million YouTube views, compelling Wired Magazine to remark, &quot;Casey Neistat’s bite-size Internet movies have so much viral potential they make influenza jealous.&quot; Let&#039;s not even get into his continent-sized following on Snapchat (check out his ancillary Snap Stories YouTube Channel), or the fact that he recently began posting a daily vlog so stellar, suddenly every other vlogger looks remedial. 

Putting out a volume of content that would rival a major network, Casey Neistat is truly a do-it-yourself triumph -- famed and fêted for unceasingly documenting his life, globe-trotting adventures and myriad curiosities with boundless perspicacity and bootstrapping panache.



So what is it exactly that makes Casey&#039;s work so irresistible? Maybe it&#039;s simply because he knows how to tell insanely great personal stories. Perhaps it&#039;s his rapier-like knack for tapping the zeitgeist pulse. His fidelity to authenticity. Or his expertise when it comes to connecting emotionally with a signature style that always leaves you yearning for more.

If you ask me what sets Casey apart, it&#039;s something else entirely:

an absolute disregard for failure.

That, and a profound work ethic. He makes it look easy, but make no mistake: Casey Neistat works way harder than you do.

No, you can&#039;t have his life. But you can have your own. To echo Casey, if you are doing it like everyone else, you&#039;re doing it wrong. So stop following the heard.

Define your own path.

It was a treat to once again drop in on his singular Lower Manhattan studio -- &quot;one of the most compulsively organized, ridiculously customized, and mind-bogglingly gear-saturated spaces on Planet Awesome&quot; -- and I am pumped to share this conversation with one of the most interesting, creative, prolific -- and in my opinion important -- visual artists working today.

NOTE: this is a short one. Just as I was starting to hit my conversational stride, at 45 minutes in Casey had to pull the plug. As you will hear, it makes for a rather abrupt, albeit somewhat comedic end to the podcast. I&#039;m back in NYC for 10 days in June, so I will do my best to pick things up where we left off. Nonetheless, plenty of gems to mine. And yes of course, he made a little Snapchat story about the whole affair:



If you didn&#039;t tune in for our first conversation, you really should -- it&#039;s great.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.

“It’s always the struggles that define you in life. Look back at your life whether you’re 13 years old or 80 years old and it’s always the hardest times that made you who you are.”

Casey Neistat



This week marks the return of my friend Casey Neistat to the podcast.

Where to even begin...

As a filmmaker credentialed with co-creating an HBO series and laurels from prestigious outlets like Cannes, Sundance and the Independent Spirit Awards, one would expect an artist of his pedigree to be directing feature films, documentaries and television shows for mainstream media. And yet sometime around 2010, Casey opted for the road less travelled, putting the traditional filmmaker path in his rearview to blaze a different and quite surprising path more in alignment with his DIY sensibilities:

YouTube.

The great irony is that in embracing the most democratic of platforms as his primary artistic outlet, Casey has indeed become one of the most compelling and culturally relevant voices of his generation.

From his sensational "Make It Count" (my fave) to his poignant "What Would You Do with $25,000?" to his gleeful "Snowboard NYC", Casey has logged over 129 million YouTube views, compelling Wired Magazine to remark, "Casey Neistat’s bite-size Internet movies have so much viral potential they make influenza jealous." Let's not even get into his continent-sized following on Snapchat (check out his ancillary Snap Stories YouTube Channel), or the fact that he recently began posting a daily vlog so stellar, suddenly every other vlogger looks remedial. 

Putting out a volume of content that would rival a major network, Casey Neistat is truly a do-it-yourself triumph -- famed and fêted for unceasingly documenting his life, globe-trotting adventures and myriad curiosities with boundless perspicacity and bootstrapping panache.



So what is it exactly that makes Casey's work so irresistible? Maybe it's simply because he knows how to tell insanely great personal stories. Perhaps it's his rapier-like knack for tapping the zeitgeist pulse. His fidelity to authenticity. Or his expertise when it comes to connecting emotionally with a signature style that always leaves you yearning for more.

If you ask me what sets Casey apart, it's something else entirely:

an absolute disregard for failure.

That, and a profound work ethic. He makes it look easy, but make no mistake: Casey Neistat works way harder than you do.

No, you can't have his life. But you can have your own. To echo Casey, if you are doing it like everyone else, you're doing it wrong. So stop following the heard.

Define your own path.

It was a treat to once again drop in on his singular Lower Manhattan studio -- "one of the most compulsively organized, ridiculously customized, and mind-bogglingly gear-saturated spaces on Planet Awesome" -- and I am pumped to share this conversation with one of the most interesting, creative, prolific -- and in my opinion important -- visual artists working today.

NOTE: this is a short one. Just as I was starting to hit my conversational stride, at 45 minutes in Casey had to pull the plug. As you will hear, it makes for a rather abrupt, albeit somewhat comedic end to the podcast. I'm back in NYC for 10 days in June, so I will do my best to pick things up where we left off. Nonetheless, plenty of gems to mine. And yes of course, he made a little Snapchat story about the whole affair:



If you didn't tune in for our first conversation, you really should -- it's great.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.

Peace + Plants,

Julie Piatt


I have some serious sustainability concerns about doing two podcasts a week. It&#039;s just an absurd amount of work. But I&#039;m keeping my promise. Plus, I&#039;m having fun. So here we go with another round of Ask Me Anything -- a twist on my typical long-form interview format where we speak to the issues you want addressed.
This is my way of deepening my connection with the global community of people who enjoy the show. And community is the very thing that carries the potential energy to truly shift cultural paradigms across the globe, one listener at a time.
Today marks one week until our new book The Plantpower Way hits stores all across North America. It&#039;s been quite a mind blowing journey to arrive at this quite privileged place, so Julie and I check in on where things currently stand in our Herculean attempt to launch a plant-based lifestyle primer into the mainstream.
Long story short? Everything is going great. To be totally transparent, today we eclipsed 4,000 books pre-sold and over 1.5 million in social reach on our Thunderclap campaign. Unbelievable!
This is because of you. The support you have given us is beyond what we could have ever imagined, so please know that our appreciation runs deep. Very deep.
And yet much work remains to be done. If we want to hit the NY Times Bestseller List and catapult the book -- and the plant-based movement -- into the cultural zeitgeist, we need to sell at least 7,000 books before May 1.
We simply cannot do this alone. So far the TODAY Show hasn&#039;t called. We&#039;re getting no love from Dr. Oz, Good Morning America, John Stewart or any other major national news outlet. So when I say we are relying on you -- the community -- to step up and help get the word out and make this happen, I f*$ing mean it.
If you are a fan of the podcast and all the content I work tirelessly to provide free each week, this is your moment of reckoning. The fact that our amazing pre-order gift bundles expire on April 28 should be enough self-serving motivation to act. But if not, consider this: despite your assumed personal proclivity for all things wellness, right now millions of people across the world are sick; stuck in a downward spiral of negative eating and lifestyle habits that promote disease and are unnecessarily killing us. 70% of Americans are obese or overweight. 1 out of every 3 Americans will die of heart disease. By 2030, 50% of us will be diabetic or pre-diabetic. Meanwhile America is exporting this lifestyle overseas with reckless abandon. And yet 80-90% of chronic lifestyle illness is preventible or reversible via simple diet and lifestyle changes.

The Plantpower Way is the solution to this insanity.

This not hyperbole. If my story means anything, it&#039;s that sustainable health and well being is accessible and available to us all, irrespective of age or circumstance. And I promise that this book will get you there -- the most powerful, life altering gift you can give to yourself; to your loved ones; to your children; to our animal friends; and to the planet.

We encourage all of you to support independent bookstores by ordering from your local retailer (and engage them to place extra orders for future customers), but for those moved by my call to action that demand instant gratification, these links will get you right where you want to be:
Amazon | Amazon.ca | Amazon.uk | Barnes &amp; Noble | IndieBound | iTunes | Penguin

If you need a sneek peek, our friend and fellow wellness warrior Kris Carr shares 4 recipes from the book on her site, including:


	Cleansing Beet Soup
	Superfood Pad Thai
	Coconut Ginger Ice Cream; and
	Veggie Burgers (one of my faves)

In an effort to say thank you and express our gratitude for the ongoing support, we are proud to remind you that we are offering:

Okay, enough. Moving on to today's listener submitted inquiries. This is a great conversation that explores:


	tools for effectively communicating with family and partners regarding lifestyle choices;
	how to create effective, healthy boundaries;
	self-sovereignty and how to live your truth;
	the leap of faith required to take professional risks;
	how to find the love in competition; and culminates with
	Cry - an original song by SriMati (aka Julie)

Gratitude to Lexi, Dylan, Kris &amp; Ann-Marie for the fantastic questions addressed in today’s podcast with an extra special thanks to Vibha (age 12) for her precocious, inspiring and insightful letter.
And of course thank you to you everyone who submitted the 100's of questions we reviewed. If we didn't get to yours (obviously chances are we didn't), nonetheless please keep them coming. I plan on doing many more supplemental Q&amp;A focused editions of the show (both with Julie and surprise guest hosts), so don't be shy.

Andy Puddicombe


I was first introduced to meditation and mindfulness principles 17 years ago during my 100-day voluntary incarceration in what is more amiably referred to as rehab.
Initially, I balked at the concept. How can stillness possibly improve my life?
Intellectually, I attributed every decent personal achievement not to innate talent, let alone some intangible force of the Universe. Instead I credited my prodigious work ethic -- a huge capacity to grind harder and longer than my peers. Get up early. Stay late. Put in the extra mile. Repeat. Never stop.
Do more.
At best, stillness meant stasis. Mostly I wrote it off as regressive -- wasted time lost. The purview of flaky, new-age hippies who couldn&#039;t begin to fathom my logic-based intellect, understand my terminally unique life problems, nor comprehend how I successfully navigated the world.
Always good for a solid re-sizing, my rehab counselor -- let&#039;s call him Hugh because that&#039;s his name -- reminded me of one simple, powerful fact:
My best thinking landed me in a mental institution.
That blast of truth and humility fell on my head like a ton of bricks. In recovery, they call it self-will run riot. And that was me, in a nutshell -- a desperate hope to die alcoholic. A broken young man who had squandered promise and destroyed his life, literally tightrope walking the divide that separates life and death.
Hardly a vision for you, It was time to try something different.
Surrender. 
At the time, I perceived this concept as synonymous with defeat. Anathema to my core idea of who I was. But Hugh was right. I was out of options, with only one saving grace -- willingness. So I (quite reluctantly) released my resistance. I let go of logic. I opened myself to possibilities beyond the rational, to something perhaps entirely unknowable. And in so doing, my life didn&#039;t just change, it transformed wholesale -- dramatically and irrevocably improving every aspect of my mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being.
I wish I could tell you that from that day forward I devoted myself to a daily meditation practice.
That didn&#039;t happen.
Newly sober, life quickly got better. Priorities rearranged, and that willingness to surrender -- the one character trait that had saved me -- started to wane until the very thing that had been so indisputably beneficial to my overall sense of self had been relegated to back seat status -- a convenient tool relied upon only when life got complicated, but hardly a consistent mainstay. Despite great appreciation for the benefits of meditation, consistency and momentum eluded me. For many years, I would practice only in spurts as a last ditch salve to alleviate some form of emotional pain.
Then about six months ago, I discovered Headspace -- a mobile app and digital platform (boasting over 1 million users) pre-packaged with an endless rotation of very accessible, secular guided meditation programs all pleasantly voiced by the company&#039;s founder and today&#039;s guest, Andy Puddicombe.
Considered &quot;the international poster boy for the modern mindfulness movement,&quot; Andy is a meditation expert, accomplished presenter and author of two books -- Get Some Headspace and The Headspace Diet, both of which have been translated into a zillion languages. An exceptional orator who has successfully popularized concepts traditionally erudite and ethereal, it&#039;s fair to say that he is doing for meditation what Jamie Oliver did for food: democratizing it.
Andy has been featured widely in international press, appearing in Vogue, the New York Times, The Financial Times, Entrepreneur, Men’s Health and Esquire, to name but a few. He&#039;s also no stranger to television and internet fame, having been featured on BBC, Dr Oz,</itunes:summary>

At best, stillness meant stasis. Mostly I wrote it off as regressive -- wasted time lost. The purview of flaky, new-age hippies who couldn't begin to fathom my logic-based intellect, understand my terminally unique life problems, nor comprehend how I successfully navigated the world.
Always good for a solid re-sizing, my rehab counselor -- let's call him Hugh because that's his name -- reminded me of one simple, powerful fact:
My best thinking landed me in a mental institution.
That blast of truth and humility fell on my head like a ton of bricks. In recovery, they call it self-will run riot. And that was me, in a nutshell -- a desperate hope to die alcoholic. A broken young man who had squandered promise and destroyed his life, literally tightrope walking the divide that separates life and death.
Hardly a vision for you, It was time to try something different.
Surrender. 
At the time, I perceived this concept as synonymous with defeat. Anathema to my core idea of who I was. But Hugh was right. I was out of options, with only one saving grace -- willingness. So I (quite reluctantly) released my resistance. I let go of logic. I opened myself to possibilities beyond the rational, to something perhaps entirely unknowable. And in so doing, my life didn't just change, it transformed wholesale -- dramatically and irrevocably improving every aspect of my mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being.
I wish I could tell you that from that day forward I devoted myself to a daily meditation practice.
That didn't happen.
Newly sober, life quickly got better. Priorities rearranged, and that willingness to surrender -- the one character trait that had saved me -- started to wane until the very thing that had been so indisputably beneficial to my overall sense of self had been relegated to back seat status -- a convenient tool relied upon only when life got complicated, but hardly a consistent mainstay. Despite great appreciation for the benefits of meditation, consistency and momentum eluded me. For many years, I would practice only in spurts as a last ditch salve to alleviate some form of emotional pain.
Then about six months ago, I discovered Headspace -- a mobile app and digital platform (boasting over 1 million users) pre-packaged with an endless rotation of very accessible, secular guided meditation programs all pleasantly voiced by the company's founder and today's guest, Andy Puddicombe.
Considered "the international poster boy for the modern mindfulness movement," Andy is a meditation expert, accomplished presenter and author of two books -- Get Some Headspace and The Headspace Diet, both of which have been translated into a zillion languages. An exceptional orator who has successfully popularized concepts traditionally erudite and ethereal, it's fair to say that he is doing for meditation what Jamie Oliver did for food: democratizing it.
Andy has been featured widely in international press, appearing in Vogue, the New York Times, The Financial Times, Entrepreneur, Men’s Health and Esquire, to name but a few. He's also no stranger to television and internet fame, having been featured on BBC, Dr Oz, Netflix and TED. In fact, Andy's TED Talk is a super entertaining must view with almost 5 million views to date.

I can't specify exactly why, but Headspace hit the spot for me. Maybe it's the ease of use. Maybe it's because it's always at my fingertips. Maybe it's Andy's soothing, accessible delivery. Then again, maybe the old adage is true:
When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.
All I can say for certain is that Headspace has helped me re-engage my practice with new enthusiasm, resulting in increased consistency, momentum and of course results. The last six months of my life have been my best -- and that is not a coincidence.
Therefore, on a personal level, it was a thrill to connect with the man himself -- a thoughtful conversation that delves deep into the power of these practices as well as Andy's quite fantastical personal story. A story that involves dropping out of university in his early twenties to study meditation in the Himalayas, followed by a ten year journey which took him around the world, culminating with ordination as a Tibetan Buddhist monk in Northern India. Prepared to live out the rest of his days in relative seclusion, one day Andy awoke with an epiphany: a yearning to return West and share his experience with the world.
Andy's transition back to lay life in 2004 was no less extraordinary. Training briefly at Moscow State Circus, he returned to London where he completed a degree in Circus Arts with the Conservatoire of Dance and Drama, whilst drawing up the early plans for what was later to become Headspace. The rest is history.

From monk to millionaire, Andy is indeed the post-modern mashup of Hesse's Siddhartha meets Paramahansa Yogananda -- the man who first introduced yoga to the West in the 1920's.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the story of a most remarkable man and most unlikely entrepreneur.

Peace + Plants,



P.S. - For purposes of clarity, I have no business or contractual relationship with Headspace whatsoever and am not a paid endorser of the company. I simply love what they do and am proud to help spread the Headspace message and mission.

It&#039;s been a while, but Julie and I are finally back with another installment of Ask Me Anything -- a twist on my typical format where we answer questions submitted by you, the listener. I absolutely love this format, primarily because it connects me more deeply and authentically with the global community of people who enjoy the show. Because community is truly what it&#039;s all about.
This is an exciting time for us. We have been working super hard getting everything ready for the impending release of The Plantpower Way, so we thought it would be fun to share a little behind the scenes on why we wrote the book; the collaborative and often intense two-year process undertaken to create it; the insane amount of effort and diligence required to launch a book into the mainstream; and our ultimate aspirations for the work.
Then the conversation turns to listener submitted inquiries. A conversation that explores:


	parenting tips for temperamental teenagers;
	the nutritional needs of athletic plant-based kids;
	the journey towards service &amp; mentorship;
	tips for starting a podcast based on Rich&#039;s experience;
	gender challenges faced in the wellness lifestyle;
	pursuing a plant-based lifestyle on a budget;
	the impact of increasing nutrient density on appetite &amp; cravings; and culminates with
	In the Sun - an original song by SriMati (aka Julie)

It was really fun to once again sit down with Julie -- my wife and co-collaborator -- to engage with the audience first hand, hashing out free-form the subjects you care about most. Thank you everyone who submitted the 100&#039;s of questions we reviewed. If we didn&#039;t get to yours (obviously chances are we didn&#039;t), nonetheless please keep them coming. I plan on doing many more supplemental Q&amp;A focused editions of the show (both with Julie and surprise guest hosts), so don&#039;t be shy. Fire your queries off to info@richroll.com and we&#039;ll do our best to answer!
I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering.
Peace + Plants,

Robert Ostfeld, MD



Newsflash: heart disease is still America’s #1 killer.

Despite groundswell interest in all things wellness, the incidence of atherosclerotic disease is at an all-time high. One out of every two people in the United States will suffer some form of cardiac ailment. And one out of every three people will actually die of heart disease. Meanwhile, we are exporting the standard American diet overseas like it&#039;s the next blockbuster installment of The Avengers. The result? The developing world is now facing rates of lifestyle-related illness unprecedented in the history of humankind.

This is a disaster.

The great irony of course is that 80-90% of chronic illnesses like atherosclerosis, type-2 diabetes and obesity are preventible and oftentimes even reversible via simple diet and lifestyle alterations.

I can preach all day, but to truly capture the attention of the mainstream, catalyze seismic cultural change and put an end to avoidable disease, we desperately need more highly qualified medical professionals who understand the complicated mechanisms that lead to these diseases and are compelled to implement the preventive measures required to combat and avoid them.

This is where cardiologist Robert Ostfeld, MD comes in.

A summa cum laude graduate of the University of Pennsylvania with a medical degree from Yale and a Masters in Epidemiology from Harvard, Dr. Ostfeld did his internship and residency at prestigious Massachusetts General Hospital and his cardiology fellowship and research fellowship in Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women&#039;s Hospital - both teaching hospitals of Harvard Medical School.

An insanely smart dude with mad skills and a bulletproof resume, Robert had his pick of the litter when it came to choosing where to hang his professional hat. Most would have chosen the highest paying, most coveted cardiology department in the country. But this guy had different plans. Instead, Robert headed north of Manhattan to The Bronx to work with underprivileged populations at Montefiore Hospital, while also serving as Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

That right there says a lot about what kind of guy Robert is. But there&#039;s more to the story.

Despite training with the best at Yale and Harvard, Robert was nonetheless left with little understanding when it came to nutrition. For years thereafter, he applied evidence-based medicine, recommended a “healthier” lifestyle (which typically included a Mediterranean-style diet), and watched somewhat helplessly as his patients’ diseases all too often progressed. Frustrated and dissatisfied with his patients&#039; consistent inability to achieve true health, he started to search for alternative means of combating chronic disease.

This search led him to The China Study by T. Colin Campbell; Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn; and the documentary Forks Over Knives -- all of which irrevocably altered his medical world view. A thought:

What if I really invest myself in the lives of my patients beyond the prescription pad?

So he did, a journey that ultimately led to founding and directing the Montefiore Cardiac Wellness Program -- an immersive, holistic, preventive, team-based approach to patient care that promotes a whole-foods, plant-based diet and intensive lifestyle habit accountability. A program that changed everything for both Robert and his patients.

The results of Dr. Ostfeld&#039;s epiphany have been nothing short of extraordinary, radically and permanently improving the health and wellness of thousands. Patient tears of joy abound, buttressing a renewed love for the practice of medicine.

The stories are profound and many.</itunes:summary>

The great irony of course is that 80-90% of chronic illnesses like atherosclerosis, type-2 diabetes and obesity are preventible and oftentimes even reversible via simple diet and lifestyle alterations.

I can preach all day, but to truly capture the attention of the mainstream, catalyze seismic cultural change and put an end to avoidable disease, we desperately need more highly qualified medical professionals who understand the complicated mechanisms that lead to these diseases and are compelled to implement the preventive measures required to combat and avoid them.

This is where cardiologist Robert Ostfeld, MD comes in.

A summa cum laude graduate of the University of Pennsylvania with a medical degree from Yale and a Masters in Epidemiology from Harvard, Dr. Ostfeld did his internship and residency at prestigious Massachusetts General Hospital and his cardiology fellowship and research fellowship in Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital - both teaching hospitals of Harvard Medical School.

An insanely smart dude with mad skills and a bulletproof resume, Robert had his pick of the litter when it came to choosing where to hang his professional hat. Most would have chosen the highest paying, most coveted cardiology department in the country. But this guy had different plans. Instead, Robert headed north of Manhattan to The Bronx to work with underprivileged populations at Montefiore Hospital, while also serving as Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

That right there says a lot about what kind of guy Robert is. But there's more to the story.

Despite training with the best at Yale and Harvard, Robert was nonetheless left with little understanding when it came to nutrition. For years thereafter, he applied evidence-based medicine, recommended a “healthier” lifestyle (which typically included a Mediterranean-style diet), and watched somewhat helplessly as his patients’ diseases all too often progressed. Frustrated and dissatisfied with his patients' consistent inability to achieve true health, he started to search for alternative means of combating chronic disease.

This search led him to The China Study by T. Colin Campbell; Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn; and the documentary Forks Over Knives -- all of which irrevocably altered his medical world view. A thought:

What if I really invest myself in the lives of my patients beyond the prescription pad?

So he did, a journey that ultimately led to founding and directing the Montefiore Cardiac Wellness Program -- an immersive, holistic, preventive, team-based approach to patient care that promotes a whole-foods, plant-based diet and intensive lifestyle habit accountability. A program that changed everything for both Robert and his patients.

The results of Dr. Ostfeld's epiphany have been nothing short of extraordinary, radically and permanently improving the health and wellness of thousands. Patient tears of joy abound, buttressing a renewed love for the practice of medicine.

The stories are profound and many.  So I am thrilled that my sagacious and quite perspicacious friend took the time to sit down with me in New York so that I can share his powerful insights and experience with you today.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.

Dan Buettner



Somewhere along the way, you&#039;ve likely heard of something called the Blue Zones -- a term coined in reference to five hidden slivers of the world that boast the highest per capita populations of centenarians – people who thrive to 100 and beyond. Unlikely locales were people not only live inordinately long, but also seem resoundingly happier than their fellow western world equals.

Places where people forgot to die.

This is the work of my friend Dan Buettner.

A renaissance man in the truest sense, Dan transcends categorization. Global adventurer. Three-time Guinness Book world record holding endurance cyclist. National Geographic Fellow. Multiple New York Times bestselling author. A wellness and longevity superhero, Dan has keynoted speeches for Bill Clinton’s Health Matters Initiative, Google Zeitgeist, and TEDMED. He&#039;s appeared on Oprah twice and his TED Talk “How to live to be 100+” has been viewed over 2 million times.

Without mincing words, Dan is my hero. A man who exudes life. A man with huge vision. And a man whose life work has positively, permanently and quite unequivocally improved the well being of millions.

You might have caught Dan on The TODAY Show (which is featuring segments on Dan and his work throughout the week), read about him in last Sunday&#039;s PARADE magazine, seen him on NBC News or caught him on CNN&#039;s The Wonder List a few weeks ago. The common theme of these stories? Grappling with the lifestyle tenets that govern Blue Zone cultures as a means to help the rest of us live longer and better.


According to Dan, Blue Zone cultures extending wellness into Ponce De Leon territory all live in accordance with 9 identifiable, convergent lifestyle principles (listed in the show notes below). Principles that are replicable on both the individual and civic level, as demonstrated by Dan&#039;s Blue Zones Project -- a community well-being improvement initiative that has wholly transformed 20 cities and municipalities to date by implementing permanent changes to environment, policy, and social networks that make healthy choices easier.

The Blue Zones Solution, Dan&#039;s new book out this week, is a highly detailed primer that extrapolates from these principles powerful eating and lifestyle tools to transform your health. Buttressed with highly entertaining stories from Dan&#039;s travels, I highly recommend checking it out - I was lucky enough to get an advance copy, and it&#039;s a terrific read.

This is a phenomenal conversation that explores Dan&#039;s new book, the aforementioned principles and what this means for you – how we can all implement certain lifestyle tenets to live longer and, most importantly, get the absolute most out of our years.

Beyond the Blue Zone universe, I tackle the story of the man behind the vision. A story that begins with Dan&#039;s improbable encounter with the singular George Plimpton (lion of The Paris Review and another personal hero of mine) -- a visionary man who catalyzed Dan&#039;s purposeful life with one simple, yet powerful idea:

	Okinawa, Japan.
	Loma Linda, California.
	Costa Rica's isolated Nicoya Peninsula.
	Ikaria, an isolated Greek island off the coast of Turkey.

Dan's 9 principles of a Blue Zone:

	Move naturally: Get more physically active by walking in the community, do manual labor around the house and yard, and grow gardens.
	Know your purpose: People who know why they get up in the morning live up to seven years longer than those who don't.
	Down shift: To reverse inflammation related to every major age-related disease, find time each day to meditate, nap, pray or commune with friends.
	80 percent rule: It takes the stomach 20 minutes to tell the brain it is full, causing most people to accidentally overeat. Stop eating when 80 percent full.
	Plant slant: Eat a mostly plant-based diet heavy on beans, nuts and green plants. This is consistent with U.S. Department of Agriculture recommendations.
	Wine at 5: For those who have a healthy relationship with alcohol (not me), enjoy a daily glass of wine.
	Family first: Living in a thriving family is worth six extra years of life expectancy.
	Belong: Recommit, reconnect or explore a faith-based community. No matter which faith, studies show that people who show up to their faith community four times a month live an extra four to 14 years.
	Right tribe: Friends have a long-term impact on well-being. Expand a social circle to include healthy-minded, supportive people. This could be the most powerful way to add years to a life.

Gene Baur


We are all born compassionate. And we carry this powerful, inherent trait through adulthood. But often this deeply ingrained impulse becomes repressed -- quelled by childhood trauma; eroded by social constraints; overwhelmed by the harried gestalt of daily life and the denial that accompanies our compulsion for convenience and immediate gratification.
Today&#039;s guest is a powerful reminder of who we really are. A call to action to better align this core value of compassion with the countless choices we make daily that dictate how we live our lives. To be more mindful about not only what we what eat, but what we do; the hows and whys behind our behavior; and the implications of personal choice on both ourselves and the world at large.
How to describe my friend Gene Baur? Hailed as the &quot;conscience of the food movement&quot; by TIME magazine, this is a guy who has spent the last 25 years traveling extensively around the country, campaigning to raise awareness about the abuses of industrialized factory farming and our current food system. Humanitarian, environmentalist, activist, undercover investigator and best-selling author, Gene is most well known as the president &amp; co-founder of Farm Sanctuary. The first animal rescue organization dedicated to farmed animals, Farm Sanctuary shelters in New York and California provide rescue, refuge, and adoption for hundreds of farm animals each year, enabling visitors to connect with farm animals as emotional, intelligent individuals. Gene believes these animals stand as ambassadors for the billions on factory farms who have no voice, and he has dedicated his career to advocating on their behalf.
He&#039;s so handsome it makes me jealous, yet I can&#039;t help but love everything about this guy. He&#039;s a beautiful soul. And he&#039;s a darn good plant-based marathon runner &amp; ironman athlete to boot.
Now for some context. This show is no stranger to people with strong points of view. But Gene was the first true animal rights activist I interviewed (in case you missed it, you can listen to our premier conversation from June 2013 here. I’m the first to admit that my original reasons for going vegan were far more selfish than ethical. Understanding that animal rights isn&#039;t exactly everyone&#039;s cup of tea, I admit to having some trepidation about publishing that interview.
But that was 2013. In truth, that conversation changed me. Gene really disarmed what I would consider willful blindness when it came to so many facets regarding how our world functions. Today I have a very different lens on the issues that spark Gene&#039;s passion. Today, I can&#039;t imagine not sharing Gene&#039;s perspective.
For me this marks personal growth. The evolution-revolution that is the hallmark of this journey I undertook eight years ago. Because the more educated I become about how our food system actually functions to deliver meals to our plates, the more interested and outspoken I have become about advocating for change. And the more strident and diligent I have become about aligning my daily personal decisions and consumer choices with a more compassionate and communitarian set of core values.
Understand that I take no moral high ground. I&#039;m deeply flawed. But as my awareness continues to broaden, I feel a certain imperative to cast light on the ills of factory farming; the powerfully deceptive marketing tactics that drive unhealthy and inhumane consumer habits; and the extraordinary lengths to which BigFood and their adjuncts on Capitol Hill will go to keep the public blind to the harsh systemic realities of industrialized animal agriculture.
Our current system is an environmental disaster. It&#039;s a health care abomination. It&#039;s inarguably unsustainable. And it&#039;s exceedingly cruel to the animals with whom we share this planet.
There is a better way. And Gene is a great ambassador of a worthy message warranting our objective attention.

Today's guest is a powerful reminder of who we really are. A call to action to better align this core value of compassion with the countless choices we make daily that dictate how we live our lives. To be more mindful about not only what we what eat, but what we do; the hows and whys behind our behavior; and the implications of personal choice on both ourselves and the world at large.
How to describe my friend Gene Baur? Hailed as the "conscience of the food movement" by TIME magazine, this is a guy who has spent the last 25 years traveling extensively around the country, campaigning to raise awareness about the abuses of industrialized factory farming and our current food system. Humanitarian, environmentalist, activist, undercover investigator and best-selling author, Gene is most well known as the president &amp; co-founder of Farm Sanctuary. The first animal rescue organization dedicated to farmed animals, Farm Sanctuary shelters in New York and California provide rescue, refuge, and adoption for hundreds of farm animals each year, enabling visitors to connect with farm animals as emotional, intelligent individuals. Gene believes these animals stand as ambassadors for the billions on factory farms who have no voice, and he has dedicated his career to advocating on their behalf.
He's so handsome it makes me jealous, yet I can't help but love everything about this guy. He's a beautiful soul. And he's a darn good plant-based marathon runner &amp; ironman athlete to boot.
Now for some context. This show is no stranger to people with strong points of view. But Gene was the first true animal rights activist I interviewed (in case you missed it, you can listen to our premier conversation from June 2013 here. I’m the first to admit that my original reasons for going vegan were far more selfish than ethical. Understanding that animal rights isn't exactly everyone's cup of tea, I admit to having some trepidation about publishing that interview.
But that was 2013. In truth, that conversation changed me. Gene really disarmed what I would consider willful blindness when it came to so many facets regarding how our world functions. Today I have a very different lens on the issues that spark Gene's passion. Today, I can't imagine not sharing Gene's perspective.
For me this marks personal growth. The evolution-revolution that is the hallmark of this journey I undertook eight years ago. Because the more educated I become about how our food system actually functions to deliver meals to our plates, the more interested and outspoken I have become about advocating for change. And the more strident and diligent I have become about aligning my daily personal decisions and consumer choices with a more compassionate and communitarian set of core values.
Understand that I take no moral high ground. I'm deeply flawed. But as my awareness continues to broaden, I feel a certain imperative to cast light on the ills of factory farming; the powerfully deceptive marketing tactics that drive unhealthy and inhumane consumer habits; and the extraordinary lengths to which BigFood and their adjuncts on Capitol Hill will go to keep the public blind to the harsh systemic realities of industrialized animal agriculture.
Our current system is an environmental disaster. It's a health care abomination. It's inarguably unsustainable. And it's exceedingly cruel to the animals with whom we share this planet.
There is a better way. And Gene is a great ambassador of a worthy message warranting our objective attention.
This is a great conversation that spans:


	Gene's personal story beyond our first conversation;
	The hidden truths behind factory farming;
	the regulatory landscape that protects animal agriculture status quo;
	the aspirational aspects of living more compassionately; and
	Gene's 5 tenets for living what he calls The Farm Sanctuary Life

Gene shares his experiences in his aptly titled new book, Living The Farm Sanctuary Life, a cookbook &amp; lifestyle guide (sound familiar?) oriented around the aforementioned 5 tenets that advocates for a more principled, harmonious, mindful and compassionate approach to living and eating in harmony with nature and your values. It's a beautiful book and I highly suggest you check it out.

If you come to this interview with a difference of opinion, that's fine. I get it. I ask only that you please listen with an open mind.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering.
Peace + Plants,



P.S. - Don't miss Gene on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart Monday April, 6. Set the TiVo!

[UPDATE: On the podcast I misspoke and said Gene would be on The Daily Show on Wednesday April 7. That was an error. He is on Monday, April 6 - apologies!]

Robin Arzón


I&#039;m really excited to have Robin Arzón back on the show this week. From corporate lawyer to ambassador of sweat and swagger, Robin brings the heat with unique personal style and an unwavering confidence that is matched only by her unlimited vivaciousness. In the event you missed it, I highly recommend going back and listening to our first conversation, RRP #99. You also might want to go back and read (or re-read) the blog post I wrote for that one, because it&#039;s kind of awesome.
Longtime listeners know Robin is all about story. The power of story. How to properly own your story. How to properly tell your story. The capacity for story to catalyze positive change in others. And the capability we all inherently have to let go of whatever negative story we tell ourselves about ourselves -- and instead form an entirely new one.

To recap, only three years ago Robin was living a completely different life — toiling away as a corporate lawyer at one of the world’s most prestigious law firms. But a near-death experience being held hostage at gunpoint several years prior gave her the courage to not only begin a new chapter of her life, but to -- you guessed it -- tell an entirely new story about herself.

Robin jumped out on her secure career without a parachute, soared on faith arms spread wide and glided down to a graceful landing on the downtown streets of lower Manhattan like a glorious bird of prey clad in blinding color and a pair of chartreuse running shoes.

How do you describe someone who defies definition itself? Robin is so many things I struggle to find words to capture a spirit that can only be properly understood by experiencing her first hand. Nonetheless, I&#039;ll give it a shot. Today Robin is a NYC-based urban, bridge-running force of nature; an accomplished ultramarathoner (she once ran 5 marathons in 5 days across Utah); a running coach; a cycling instructor; and a consultant to some of the biggest brands in the world, like Nike, Adidas and Puma. Not enough? She&#039;s also a lifestyle entrepreneur as well the co-founder and publisher of a relatively new magazine called UNDO. Where sweat meets culture, it&#039;s a gorgeous, high quality production that can be found worldwide in places like Urban Outfitters.

But Robin is not immune from obstacles. About a year ago, she faced a unforeseen new challenge: Type 1 Diabetes. Not one to let her illness limit, let alone define her, Robin navigates this setback with the poised demeanor she meets everything -- simply another opportunity to empower and inspire others to get out of their comfort zone and, in Robin&#039;s words:

do epic shit.

As a father of two little girls, I am inspired by her shining example of positive female empowerment. It gives me hope. And she never fails to put a smile on my face while simultaneously challenging my own preconceptions about what is possible for both myself and others.

This conversation picks up where RRP #99 left off, delving further into Robin&#039;s story as we explore:

	the power of painful, &quot;sacred&quot; moments;
	overcoming comfort zones;
	the will to fail;
	the importance of awareness &amp; meditation; and
	habits for productivity and success.

My hope is that Robin empowers you to reframe, own and share the best possible story you can tell about yourself.
I’m honored to call Robin my friend and it&#039;s a privilege to share her story more deeply with you today. I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering.

		<itunes:summary>“The single most important thing you can do as a consumer is change out those 3 or 4 ounces of meat in the center of your plate.”

Ethan Brown, CEO of Beyond Meat


Right now this spinning land mass we call Earth is host to over 7 billion hungry human mouths to feed. Our current set up for handling this relentless, growing need isn&#039;t just problematic, it&#039;s broken, outdated technology that is making us sick and decimating the planet at an unfathomable rate.
If we want to preserve a vibrant planet for future generations, it is imperative we find better, more innovative, more economic, more compassionate, more sustainable ways to sate the population.

This is a long way of saying it&#039;s high time for a paradigm shift.

If you listened to my podcast with Kip Anderson and Keegan Kuhn – the guys behind the highly compelling documentary Cowspiracy (I implore you to check out both the podcast and the film if you haven&#039;t already), then you already know that industrialized animal agriculture is our #1 environmental threat -- far more deleterious to planetary health than transportation or fracking and the current leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution and habitat destruction.

Adopting a plant-based diet is the single most powerful thing we can do as consumers to take a stand against this insanity. But to truly solve this problem we need to first acknowledge that we have a serious protein fixation. Facilitating a mass cultural shift away from our strong preference towards an animal-centric diet requires more than a simple plea to go vegan. To truly break the paradigm we need phenomenal food alternatives with mainstream appeal. Products that aren&#039;t just more sustainable and consciously harvested, but inventive products that rival, if not altogether outdo our appetite for beef, chicken, fish and eggs in not just nutritional content, but in flavor, taste and texture as well.

The good news is that there are super intelligent, highly motivated people hard at work on just this -- innovating brand new ways to improve human health, positively impact climate change, address global resource constraints and improve animal welfare with products, which for lack of a better phrase, simply taste good.

Ethan Brown is one such innovator.

Conceived in 2009 as a potential solution to problems he saw with the meat industry, Ethan founded Beyond Meat with a singular goal -- to produce plant-based food products that would essentially replicate meat in an effort to render some of the downsides of the meat industry obsolete.

In the same way last week&#039;s podcast guest Joshua Katcher implicitly understands that ethically manufactured garments must outmatch their less sustainable comparisons in fashion flair, Ethan understands that to win mainstream hearts and minds, his food products need more than satisfy the palates of enthusiastic carnivores.

Backed by heavy hitters like Bill Gates and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, it&#039;s not a stretch to say Ethan is well on his way to achieving this goal. Food impresario Alton Brown called Beyond Meat&#039;s Chicken Strips &quot;more like meat than anything I&#039;ve ever seen that wasn&#039;t meat.&quot; Legendary New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman allegedly couldn&#039;t tell the difference between Ethan&#039;s product and the real thing. And Beyond Meat&#039;s newest Beast Burger offering tastes remarkably good while also boasting more protein and iron than beef, more omegas than salmon and plenty of calcium, antioxidants and vitamin B.

A disclaimer -- I’m a whole food plant-based guy. I&#039;ve never been a big fan of so-called &quot;fake meat&quot; products, most of which are rife with gluten and less than healthy preservatives. However, I recognize the crucial importance of forward thinking, tech style innovation in this space, particularly when it comes to the Herculean task of recruiting dubious tofu-phobic naysayers to the appeal of plant-based alternatives.

I won&#039;t say the products are perfect.</itunes:summary>

But to truly solve this problem we need to first acknowledge that we have a serious protein fixation. Facilitating a mass cultural shift away from our strong preference towards an animal-centric diet requires more than a simple plea to go vegan. To truly break the paradigm we need phenomenal food alternatives with mainstream appeal. Products that aren't just more sustainable and consciously harvested, but inventive products that rival, if not altogether outdo our appetite for beef, chicken, fish and eggs in not just nutritional content, but in flavor, taste and texture as well.

The good news is that there are super intelligent, highly motivated people hard at work on just this -- innovating brand new ways to improve human health, positively impact climate change, address global resource constraints and improve animal welfare with products, which for lack of a better phrase, simply taste good.

Ethan Brown is one such innovator.

Conceived in 2009 as a potential solution to problems he saw with the meat industry, Ethan founded Beyond Meat with a singular goal -- to produce plant-based food products that would essentially replicate meat in an effort to render some of the downsides of the meat industry obsolete.

In the same way last week's podcast guest Joshua Katcher implicitly understands that ethically manufactured garments must outmatch their less sustainable comparisons in fashion flair, Ethan understands that to win mainstream hearts and minds, his food products need more than satisfy the palates of enthusiastic carnivores.

Backed by heavy hitters like Bill Gates and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, it's not a stretch to say Ethan is well on his way to achieving this goal. Food impresario Alton Brown called Beyond Meat's Chicken Strips "more like meat than anything I've ever seen that wasn't meat." Legendary New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman allegedly couldn't tell the difference between Ethan's product and the real thing. And Beyond Meat's newest Beast Burger offering tastes remarkably good while also boasting more protein and iron than beef, more omegas than salmon and plenty of calcium, antioxidants and vitamin B.

A disclaimer -- I’m a whole food plant-based guy. I've never been a big fan of so-called "fake meat" products, most of which are rife with gluten and less than healthy preservatives. However, I recognize the crucial importance of forward thinking, tech style innovation in this space, particularly when it comes to the Herculean task of recruiting dubious tofu-phobic naysayers to the appeal of plant-based alternatives.

I won't say the products are perfect. Ethan's the first to acknowledge they're not. It's an ongoing development process. But they do taste pretty darn good.

There is great power in the attempt to disrupt our highly flawed food system from the inside out. I have great respect for what Ethan is trying to accomplish. So I was pumped to visit his facility in El Segundo to learn more about his mission.

This is a great discussion -- a conversation that not only tackles the ills of our current food system and how we can forge a better way but also a fascinating look into the entrepreneurship required to steward a compelling idea into a reality that just might change the world.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering.
Peace + Plants,

Joshua Katcher


We talk quite often about food on this podcast -- particularly the health, environmental and ethical implications our collective dietary choices and the global impact of the industrialized food industry on the same.
But you might be less consciously aware of the massive extent to which the garment industry impacts a wide range of concerns from global climate change to animal welfare to ethics and beyond.

Fashion is a world that desperately needs an environmentally conscious, sustainability-focused and ethically driven facelift. A world I wanted to know more about. Irrespective of whether you are an avid reader of Vogue or favor dad jeans, this is a world that merits our attention.

To learn more, I sat down with professor, fashion designer, and blogger Joshua Katcher -- the founder &amp; creative director behind the sustainable, ethically conscious high-end fashion line Brave GentleMan and the founder of The Discerning Brute – a men’s lifestyle website that focuses on fashion, food, etiquette and ethics profiling creative-influencers who want to redesign the world, redefine success, and look good doing it. Joshua is also a public lecturer and adjunct professor of fashion at Parsons The New School, where his research focuses on sustainability and ethics in fashion production.

This conversation offers a quite revealing and at times uncomfortable look at the truth behind exactly how most clothes are manufactured, distributed and marketed to drive consumer purchasing trends. It&#039;s not pretty. But there is a solution. Joshua and his work is part of that solution -- leveraging forward-thinking, modern textiles and progressive, business practices that embrace fashion and aesthetics to bring consumers beautiful, better and quite honestly, more ethically imagined and manufactured garments for us to enjoy.

This is a really interesting talk about:

	the complex intersection of ethics, aesthetics and fashion;
	the social norms and parameters that define masculinity;
	why fur is the furthest thing from cool;
	what really goes into creating garments from wool;
	the environmental impact of raising animals for clothing;
	the advent of more sustainable and ethically manufactured materials for garments; and
	the realities behind what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur in the garment industry.

Highly intelligent, hyper-articulate and of course always bespoke, Joshua is an outstanding ambassador and aesthete of modern fashion modalities, not to mention badass at CrossFit to boot. It&#039;s my honor to share my friend Joshua&#039;s message and experience with you and my hope is that you will come away from this conversation more enlightened and educated when it comes to aligning your consumerism with your values. I did.

Even if fashion is not your thing, trust me. This compelling exchange just might surprise you. I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering.

Preston Smiles



From a young, troubled gang member facing an almost certain future of jails and institutions to becoming one of today&#039;s freshest voices in the conscious media movement, the life arc of Preston Smiles is something to behold. So it&#039;s a pleasure to welcome my friend back to the podcast.

Inspirational speaker. Motivational messenger. Fount of creative positivity. All around solid, loving dude.

If you are relatively new to the RRP, I strongly suggest rewinding the podcast back to my first sit down with today&#039;s guest (RRP #103) for the full Preston Smiles lowdown and origin story -- a conversation that ranks right up there amongst some of the most popular and downloaded episodes in the history of the show.

I am proud to share this powerful conversation with you today. A conversation that traverses a tapestry of mental, emotional and spiritual topics and truisms, including healthy strategies for:

	navigating relationship pitfalls;
	overcoming the scarcity mentality;
	learning how to access, attract and accept abundance into your life; and
	why none of us should be afraid to love loudly in our quest to embrace our highest self.

I&#039;m a better dude for having Preston in my life. I truly enjoyed this conversation and sincerely hope you do too.

Peace + Plants,



P.S. - To all you listeners in Australia: Preston is Down Under for the next few weeks, so let&#039;s do him a solid. Hit him up on social media, show him a little Aussie love and let&#039;s help him have the trip of his lifetime. Deal?

Jennifer Steinman



Futurist and science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke famously said, the only way to find the limits of the possible is by going beyond them to the impossible. An apropos theme for my conversation with Jennifer Steinman, a documentary filmmaker who spent well over a year following four seemingly normal, far from professional athletes as they prepare for and undertake one of the most grueling, backbreaking endurance challenges on the planet -- a collection of ultra-distance adventure footraces teetering on the absurd dubbed the 4 Desert Series.
WHAT IS THE 4 DESERTS?
Named by TIME magazine as one of the world&#039;s Top 10 Endurance Competitions, the 4 Deserts is the world&#039;s leading rough-country endurance footrace series. A unique collection of world-class events that take place over 7 days and 250 kilometers in the largest and most forbidding deserts on the planet.

Jennifer has a more poetic take on this lunatic fringe:

Imagine you’ve been dropped off in the middle of one of the largest, driest deserts in the World. Over the next six days you will have to run, jog, walk or crawl 155 miles through incessant heat, across soft sand and hard-packed gravel, over sand dunes multiple stories high and down razor-sharp rocky cliffs. You must do this carrying everything you need to survive — clothes, food, sunscreen, emergency medical supplies, sleeping bag — in a 20-pound pack on your back.

Now imagine doing this not just once, but four times in one calendar year, through the driest, windiest, hottest, coldest and ultimately the most treacherous four deserts in the world: the Atacama Desert in Chile, the Gobi Desert in China, the Sahara in Egypt… and then, the final stage, a 150-mile footrace across the single most inhospitable landscape in the world: The Last Desert in Antarctica.

Any single race in RacingThePlanet’s 4Desert Ultramarathon Series is an extraordinary, life-threatening challenge– something we would only expect the most accomplished, elite athletes on the planet to try. But most of the courageous men and women who come from all over the world to compete in these Herculean events are not professional athletes at all, they’re ordinary people—people with families and day jobs and mortgage payments– people like you and me who have decided, for a variety of personal reasons, to take on this extreme physical challenge.

Why do they do it?

This week&#039;s guest set out to answer this question. The result is Desert Runners -- a feature length character-driven documentary that follows a remarkable collection of brave souls on an extraordinary year-long adventure, racing to the four corners of the Earth.

This is a conversation about:

	 the drive to discover one’s limits;
	the struggle to escape the comfort zone of modern living;
	what it means to seek adventure over security; and
	the mettle necessary to go beyond the edge – and take a blind leap of faith into the unknown.

Even if you don’t care about ultra-marathon running, this is a valuable exchange well worth your time. Because if you think about it, everybody is an ultramarathoner. I don’t care if you have never run a single mile. Life is the ultimate ultramarathon.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.

Julie Piatt



Let&#039;s talk about food. Despite all the diet and nutrition content I consistently and freely generate, Julie and I are still inundated daily with inquiries like:
So what exactly do you guys eat?
How can I get my kids to make healthier choices?
Is it possible to eat healthy on a budget?
How can I overcome my cravings for unhealthy foods?
And of course...Where do you get your protein?
It&#039;s questions like these that led to an epiphany: I think it&#039;s time for the next book.

A cookbook.

However, there is is no shortage of amazing plant-based cookbooks already available. What could Julie and I possibly bring to this conversation that hasn&#039;t already been said?

After pouring through all the cookbooks at our local Barnes &amp; Noble, we made a rather shocking discovery -- not a single plant-based cookbook seemed to speak directly to the primary concerns of the typical modern family.

So we started to think about how we could fill this gap by providing real, tangible guidance for the soccer moms and softball playing dads with young kids just looking to live a little healthier. Normal people searching for a simple, solid roadmap to make better choices at the market and in the kitchen. A book that would really address the true needs of everyday, budget-conscious folks too busy to study nutrition yet seeking easy-to-implement answers. A book that would guide, educate and inspire people to adopt healthier eating and lifestyle habits and instill such habits in their children.

Visualizing such a book was easy. Because it&#039;s just a natural, authentic extension of our every day family lifestyle. A lifestyle we call The Plantpower Way.



It&#039;s taken more than two years of solid focused work to get this book right. So this week Julie and I thought it would be fun sit down and learn more about her personal journey in food while rehashing the long journey undertaken to finally birth this book to life.
WHAT IS THE PLANTPOWER WAY?
Everybody deserves optimal health. And wellness begins with what we put on our plate. But that&#039;s just the beginning. So we decided to pick up where every other cookbook leaves off by providing concrete tools, tips and general lifestyle guidance to foster long-term wellness and catalyze your journey towards unlocking your best, most authentic self.

Bursting with inspiration, practical guidance, and beautiful food and lifestyle photography, The Plantpower Way features more than 120 of Julie&#039;s delicious, easy-to-prepare whole food recipes, certain to delight even the most finicky or carnivorous of your clan.

But this is more than a mere cookbook. It&#039;s a fully formed, comprehensive lifestyle primer chock-a-block with information, tools, resources and inspiration to not only answer all those questions we field daily, but elevate and guide the modern family towards healthier, more sustainable food, lifestyle and parenting practices. Both evolutionary and revolutionary, it&#039;s a book you will proudly use every day, share with colleagues, eagerly gift family members and even display on your coffee table for friends to peruse and enjoy.
WE NEED YOUR HELP!
Although the book doesn&#039;t hit stores until April 28, it is currently available for pre-order. The way publishing works, pre-orders are very important in terms of setting up the book for long-term success. The number of units sold during the pre-order window count towards first week sales. These numbers influence retail buyer habits (i.e., how many copies of the book your local Barnes &amp; Noble decides to order) and are used to compile bestseller lists. In other words, this is an important time, and quite frankly we really need your help.

Towards this end, we have put together an incredible array of premium pre-order bonus giveaways valued at over $300,000.00. Tons of amazing products from our good friends at great companies (see below show notes). If for no other reason than appreciation for all the free content I have provided over the years, we would love it if you took a leap of faith and pre-ordered the book (a $29 investment that will yield over $75 in value). Better yet? Pre-order a whole bunch of books, reap the bonus rewards and give the books out as gifts. And while you're at it, take a quick moment to spread the word about our bonus offers with your friends and on social media.

But please understand one thing: -- we are not trying to get you to buy something you don't want. These gifts are our way of giving back. Our way of saying thank you. Seriously and sincerely, thank you for taking this journey with us. Thank you for being the highly engaged and passionate audience that you are. And thank you for shepherding this Plantpower revolution beyond the realm of my imagination.

In other words, this is not about me. It's about the movement. And the movement is everything.

Right now the U.S. is in the midst of an almost unspeakable health care and environmental crisis. Heart disease, obesity and diabetes are killing people by the millions and incidence is on the rise. Meanwhile, animal agriculture is depleting our soil, destroying our oceans, devastating our rainforests and creating more green house gas emissions than all of transportation combined. Our systems of food production and health care are simply not sustainable. We're running out of time. The insanity must stop.

Despite this rather grim reality, the solution has been staring us in the face all along. The simple inescapable truth is that 80-90% of chronic illness is preventible or reversible via a whole food plant-based lifestyle. A lifestyle choice that will render your health bulletproof to western disease and impact the environment more positively than any other single decision or act you will take for the rest of your life.

The Plantpower Way is our contribution to this solution. A book we know holds the power to change lives. We just need your help getting it out there.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

Peace + Plants,

In 2005, New York City firefighter, avid marathoner and ironman athlete Matt Long hopped onto his bike to do what he did every day -- ride from his East side Manhattan apartment north to the Randall&#039;s Island fire academy where he helped train the city’s bravest. As he crossed 52nd Street, a 20-ton bus made a right turn from the middle lane. The bus didn&#039;t just hit him, it dragged his body completely underneath, where Matt was then quite literally impaled by his bike.

After receiving 68 units of blood in the first 40 hours post-accident, Matt spent the next month in a coma.

When he woke up, the doctors told him he was facing a one percent chance of survival.

Matt had other plans.

After a 5-month hospital stint and 40 surgeries in under two years, he did more than survive. He finally came alive.

The story of Matt’s accident and his comeback quest to tackle the 2008 NYC marathon just 3 years after his accident was first chronicled in an extraordinary story in Runner&#039;s World by Charles Butler entitled A Second Life. That story was later adapted and expanded into Matt&#039;s exceptionally inspiring memoir, The Long Run, a work of co-authorship by Long and Butler (not to be confused with my buddy and RRP favorite Mishka Shubaly&#039;s equally compelling Kindle Single, also entitled The Long Run).

Today Matt will tell you not only does he not regret the accident, it is the one thing that has made him whole.



There are many words that can be used to describe Matt -- firefighter, 9/11 first responder, ironman athlete, accomplished marathoner, advocate, bon vivant, husband and father. But one word will suffice: hero.

Matt is a man I hold in high regard as an incredible example of the resiliency not just of the physical body, but of the emotional body -- the indomitable, boundless strength of the human spirit in selfless service to others.

Great guy. Great talk.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.

Jason Hall, Oscar-Nominated Screenwriter of &quot;American Sniper&quot;



Jason Hall is having a moment. The country is having a moment.

Although hardly an overnight success story, it&#039;s fair to say American Sniper is this talented screenwriter&#039;s big break. A break so big he just might win his first Oscar a few days from today. But the celebratory mood is tempered by one inescapable fact: it is constructed from the tragic demise of a man named Chris Kyle. The soldier who not only serves as this contentious movie&#039;s protagonist, but was also a man Jason called friend.

In an era when studios shy away from war movies as box office poison, American Sniper is an unsuspecting juggernaut. Breaking records left and right, the Bradley Cooper starrer seems to have touched a national nerve, packing theatres across the U.S. to the tune of over $300 million domestically and a fast approaching $400 million worldwide gross. Not only is American Sniper Clint Eastwood&#039;s most successful film to date, it&#039;s the highest grossing war film of all time.

And yet the film is not without its critics and controversy. Propaganda or protest movie? War polemic or character study? The glorification of a highly skilled killer or the tragic tale of one man&#039;s demise? 

Let the pundits pontificate, Jason Hall would say. The important thing is that people are now talking about things that need talking about.

Irrespective of your personal feelings about this film, you cannot deny that it is a work that demands to be reckoned with. A reckoning that has catalyzed a productive dialog around a litany of important issues such as:

	the incidence and treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) in today’s soldiers;
	the physical, mental and emotional impact of multiple deployments on soldiers, their families and society; and
	how to systemically improve the much needed care and support we provide our troops.

This is the dialog that interests Jason – a guy with his feet on the ground who really gets that the success of this movie is not about him. It&#039;s about service. It’s about the responsibility we collectively shoulder as a society – irrespective of politics -- to do a much better job of taking proper care of the men and women who voluntarily enlist to place their lives on the line daily, and without reservation.

This is a compelling conversation about many things, from the machinations of Hollywood to the fragility of life. But to me, this is about the responsibility to make your journey about something bigger and more important than your self and your ego.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.

Jason Hall is having a moment. The country is having a moment.

But the celebratory mood is tempered by one inescapable fact: it is constructed from the tragic demise of a man named Chris Kyle. The soldier who not only serves as this contentious movie's protagonist, but was also a man Jason called friend.

		<itunes:summary>&quot;The moral standard isn&#039;t always scientifically sound.&quot;

Vani Hari



Remember that big deal about how the bread at Subway contains chemicals found in yoga mats?

Then there was the story about how fast food French fries contain a chemical used in Silly Putty. And the whole to-do about how there’s actually no pumpkin in the Starbucks pumpkin latte.

The person behind these semi-salacious, headline grabbing campaigns is this week’s guest, Vani Hari – aka Food Babe – the outspoken and often divisive food activist behind the wildly popular FoodBabe.com blog.

I met Vani at a dinner party this past summer and found her not only delightful but also razor sharp, fiercely passionate and tenacious when the subject turned to food — particularly what big food manufacturers don’t want you to know about what’s in our food. Her message? To empower the typical soccer mom with the information to feed her family right and the courage to stand up for greater transparency and accountability from companies that produce what ends up on our plates.

FoodBabe.com, which exceeds an astounding 2.5 million unique visitors per month,  along with the mobilization of Vani’s passionate Food Babe Army following, has been incredibly successful in getting gigantic companies like Subway, Kraft, Chipotle, Chick-fil-A, and even Anheuser-Busch to not only remove certain harmful ingredients from their food but also steer them toward more healthful policies.



Therefore, it should come as no surprise that food companies are terrified of her. Her voice and legion of supporters pose a significant threat to corporate profits and business as usual. This makes her a target. Attacked daily, it’s not uncommon for her to receive death threats. But that’s what happens when you really put yourself out there, on the front lines.

The fact that she soldiers on is super ballsy. She is a warrior. Totally punk rock. The Erin Brockovitch of food.

Congressman Tim Ryan calls her Vani “a one woman consumer protection agency.” And I for one have tremendous respect for anyone who demonstrates her level of courage and advocacy.

Vani and I were supposed to sit down in person in New York a couple weeks ago but the big storm that never was left her with a cancelled flight and compelled me to break my cardinal rule and host this conversation on Skype. I never do this, but I think Vani’s message is potent and important and it didn’t appear we would be in the same city at the same  time again anytime soon, so I took a chance and I’m glad I did.

This is a great talk. A talk about how all of us, irrespective of our personal dietary proclivities, can live a cleaner, more organic and healthier lifestyle in today’s overprocessed, contaminated-food world.

This is a talk about corporate responsibility and corporate transparency.

This is a talk about government oversight and regulation of our food, our food companies, and the ingredients that find their way into our food.

And most importantly, from my perspective, this is a talk about the inherent power and responsibility we hold as as consumers to be advocates; to raise our voice and be heard; to hold the people behind the food we eat more accountable for how its made and what goes into it.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

And most importantly, from my perspective, this is a talk about the inherent power and responsibility we hold as as consumers to be advocates; to raise our voice and be heard; to hold the people behind the food we eat more accountable for how its made and what goes into it.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

		<itunes:summary>America&#039;s #1 killer, heart disease currently kills 1 out of every 3 Americans; 70% of Americans are obese and getting fatter; and Studies forecast that by 2030, 50% of Americans will be diabetic or pre-diabetic.



The great irony in all of this is that, as Dr. Kahn so astutely points out, 80-90% of all chronic health problems can be resolved via pretty simple diet and lifestyle alternations.

The tricky part is translating these lifestyle alterations from theory to practice. I understand that it can be difficult for many, particularly when there is so much confusing information out there concerning about heath, nutrition and diet. So confusing in fact, that it becomes incredibly challenging for even the most savvy consumer to separate fact from fiction and truth from hyperbole.

Just because good news about bad habits makes for tempting clickbait doesn&#039;t mean the information is reliable -- its usually not.

To help sift through all of this, I once again sit down for a heart to heart (pun intended) with cardiologist Joel Kahn, MD -- you can listen to our first conversation (RRP #44) here.

A Summa Cum Laude graduate of the University of Michigan&#039;s prestigious Inteflex program (a 6-year undergraduate / graduate program that developed doctors fresh out of high school), Joel has served as Clinical Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at Wayne State University School of Medicine since 1993. He&#039;s authored over 130 articles on heart disease, is a frequent lecturer on heart disease and its prevention, has performed thousands of cardiac procedures, and has been advising patients on heart healthy programs for over 20 years.

Not only does Dr. Kahn know what he is talking about, his basic message is elementary: if you want to experience true long-term wellness, then you must focus on implementing sustainable long-term preventive protocols into your lifestyle. This starts and ends with diet and active lifestyle.

The specific thrust of this conversation focuses on separating truth from marketing with respect to certain zeitgeist trends in nutrition science. To wit:
Is butter really back?
What are the health impacts of a low carb / high fat diet?
What are the risks (and benefits, if any) of trendy practices like putting butter and oil in your morning coffee?
Is everything we thought we knew about saturated fat truly wrong?
Who was Ancel Keys and what is the import of his nutritional studies?
What is the true impact of dietary cholesterol on arterial and heart health?
Finally, and most importantly, what specific dietary and lifestyle protocols does this veteran cardiologist recommend to maintain optimal heart health in a culture in which heart disease has become a wildly out of control pandemic?

You&#039;ll want to tune in to find out.

Amazingly informative, this is straight talk from a solid guy. An awesome and trusted and educated and experienced and entertaining guy I am proud to call my friend.

I sincerely hope you heed the call and enjoy the conversation.

		<itunes:summary>What can mined from the abyss that separates ordinary from extraordinary?

Although he&#039;s never pedaled a single stage of the Tour de France as a professional cyclist, Mike Cotty has done things on the bike that would make even Jens Voigt (the consensus hard man of the pro peloton) cringe.

Here&#039;s a taste. Last summer Mike rode his bike 1000 kilometers non-stop across 21 mountains in the Dolomites, Eastern Alps and Swiss Alps, from Conegliano, Italy, to Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, France. That&#039;s over 21,000 meters in elevation gain. That&#039;s 54 hours of riding without sleep. That&#039;s like riding 8 to 10 stages of the Tour de France without stopping.

How is that even humanly possible?

Mike also rode 684 kilometers for 30 hours straight across the Pyrenees from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. A feat rivaled only by his 33-hour, 677 kilometer ride that ascended 16,000 meters of elevation gain across the Alps.



Obviously I wouldn&#039;t characterize Mike as normal. Far from it. But there is a very relatable everyman aspect to Mike&#039;s story that captured my fancy.

Mike&#039;s path has hardly been linear, but today he is not only an extraordinarily accomplished athlete, he is a respected filmmaker, brand ambassador, media &amp; marketing consultant and entrepreneur. Through his company Media-24, Mike creates compelling content and develops marketing strategy for top tier organizations like Mavic, Cannondale and the Cannondale-Garmin professional cycling team. Mike&#039;s latest passion project is The Col Collective, a high quality online video resource dedicated to helping inspire and educate cyclists to reach the summit of the most spectacular mountain passes in the world.



Mike&#039;s is also a path without ego, well grounded in a true desire to educate, positively impact and inspire people to overcome their own barriers. All these elements make for great conversation about passion. About pushing past that voice in your head that wants you to quit. About what is required to break through seemingly insurmountable barriers. And about the self-discovery incident to attempting something personally unprecedented.

This is a conversation about the value and importance of hard work over the life hack. About the pain, suffering, joy and pride that comes with embracing the journey. About living in balance with nature. About faith, having a strong conviction about yourself and the path ahead. And it&#039;s about what&#039;s required to turn your passion into your profession.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

		<itunes:summary>&quot;The road to a good picture is through a lot of bad ones.&quot; - Sam Jones



 
This week&#039;s episode is a bit of a departure. But like Frost&#039;s road less travelled, it&#039;s a direction well worth pursuing.

My podcast was borne from a love of the art of the long form conversation. Authentic expression is a predominant theme of virtually every episode. And I sheepishly admit to a slight obsession with talented people at the nadir of their creativity, expressing their specific life purpose with unapologetic conviction.

Sam Jones is the embodiment and ethos of all these ideals and more. Lauded photographer, documentary filmmaker, award winning music video director, magazine publisher, television creator and podcast host. Oh yeah, he&#039;s also married with kids.

As a photographer, Sam is the go to guy for top tier magazines such as Vanity Fair, Esquire, Rolling Stone, GQ and Time for creating timeless portraits of luminaries, A-list actors and musicians like Barak Obama, George Clooney, Robert Downey Jr., Bob Dylan, Jack Nicholson and Dave Grohl.



All of this is super cool of course. But quite frankly it&#039;s not what motivated me to want to sit down with Sam. What really captivated me about this talented artist is Sam&#039;s newest venture, a multi-media, multi-faceted project he created entitled offCamera.

It&#039;s photography. It&#039;s a magazine. It&#039;s a television show. It&#039;s a podcast. It&#039;s journalism. It&#039;s entertainment. It&#039;s art - the art of exquisite portraiture achieved through images, words and conversation.

Simply put, Sam performs up close and personal, uninterrupted long-form conversations with today&#039;s most prolific cultural icons - people like Matt Damon, Sarah Silverman, Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Laura Dern and more. Each conversation is filmed for initial broadcast on DirectTV&#039;s Audience Network and subsequently available on the offCamera website as well as on iTunes as an audio podcast. Accompanied by a formal portrait, the interviews are also reformatted in print to comprise a printed magazine.

After listening to Sam&#039;s intimate dialog with Robert Downey Jr., I was left to ponder this question: where else could I possibly listen to (or watch) someone like this converse for a full hour on the particulars of life and art?

Nowhere. You can&#039;t. Blame our soundbite obsessed world, but conversations like these are extremely rare if not altogether nonexistent in publicly available form. Complemented by his extraordinary attention to detail and quality, these are all reasons why Sam&#039;s work is such a gift to us all.

I have been so moved by offCamera that I felt compelled to turn the mic around, point it at Sam and get to the bottom of his story. Thank you Sam for your willingness to engage me in a dynamic conversation that explores the intersection of art and commerce; the importance of authenticity in the expression of one&#039;s creativity; and what can be learned from working with the most prolific musicians, actors, filmmakers and artists in the world.

In the words of Sam,
&quot;it has taken me a lifetime to develop my attention span, and I want to use it.&quot;
Me too Sam. Me too. I sincerely hope you enjoy the listen.

"The road to a good picture is through a lot of bad ones." - Sam Jones



 
This week's episode is a bit of a departure. But like Frost's road less travelled, it's a direction well worth pursuing.

And I sheepishly admit to a slight obsession with talented people at the nadir of their creativity, expressing their specific life purpose with unapologetic conviction.

		<itunes:summary> &quot;The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest her or his patients in the care of the human frame, in a proper diet, and in the cause and prevention of the disease.”
Thomas Edison


If we want to repair our broken health care system and move culture towards true, long-term sustainable wellness, then medicine must embrace a a new approach to healing. An approach that&#039;s so new, it&#039;s old.
Less reductive, more holistic.Less diagnose &amp; prescribe and more all-encompassing, functional and preventive.
Let’s kick start that conversation. This week&#039;s guest is nutritionist, acupuncturist, herbalist, Reiki Master and expert Chinese Medicine practitioner Heather Lounsbury, author of Fix Your Mood with Food.
Although she gave up meat nearly 30 years ago for ethical reasons, Heather was a junk food vegetarian with zero interest health until hers hit the skids. Moody and constantly fatigued, she began experimenting with nutrition and was astonished to discover the extent to which she could modulate her physical and emotional vitality relative to the types of foods she would eat. This realization lead Heather to pursue graduate degrees in nutrition and Chinese medicine. Today Heather is a well respected clinical practitioner with over a decade of experience treating patients with a wide variety of mental, emotional and physical issues.
Her basic message? Live natural. Live well. Food has a far greater impact than we recognize on not only our physical health but on our mental and emotional health as well. Not only can proper diet (amplified by additional holistic healing measures) alleviate stress and elevate your mood naturally, it can prevent and often reverse a wide variety of chronic infirmities, including heart disease, elevated cholesterol, digestive issues, diabetes (diabesity!) and more.
Over the course of our conversation we discuss:
How pain and digestive disorders can be holistically managed and alleviated;How holistic healing practices can be used to treat mental health &amp; addiction issues;The importance of progress over perfection;The role and function of certain herbs on physiological functions;Primer and origin of food allergies;Thoughts on GMO’s, Omega- 3 EFA&#039;s &amp; Supplementation; andAddressing the social barriers that impede healthy eating.
Lots of good stuff to chew on this week. I hope you enjoy the conversation.

Jake Ducey 


What if the path you think you&#039;re meant to be living isn&#039;t your path at all?
I grappled with this mental and spiritual Rubik’s cube for decades. Only now -- at 48 -- do I feel like I have any insight whatsoever into this quandary.
Not so with today’s guest. After a drunken car accident at age 19, Jake Ducey had an epiphany: maybe, just maybe, the traditional promise of the American Dream isn&#039;t my path to happiness and personal fulfillment. What did he do with this realization? He up and quit school, walking out on a collegiate basketball scholarship to instead light out and travel the world.
Along the way, Jake chronicled his journey, distilling his insights down to a book entitled Into the Wind. Undaunted by being turned down by every publisher, he nonetheless self-published his book. And without any marketing budget or publicist, Jake still managed to self-promote Into the Wind to Amazon’s top 300 - no small accomplishment.
Jake subsequently piqued the interest and mentorship of people like Chicken Soup for the Soul author Jack Canfield and Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus author John Gray. He became a TEDx speaker. And at 23, Jake became the youngest author to land a motivational book publishing deal at a major publishing house (Tarcher/Penguin).
The Purpose Principles – hitting book stores this week -- is the product of Jake&#039;s journey to date, drawing on the stories of success, failure, and the common threads among some of today’s most successful and influential people to illuminate a plan for living your best life in a changing world – a theme not inconsistent with this show.
I’ve hosted more than a few impressive young and precocious twenty-somethings on the show over the last two years because I love getting the millennial perspective on life. I like young people and as a parent of two teenage boys and two soon to be teenage girls, I truly want to understand what makes the next generation tick. What is important to millennials? What is the lens through which they perceive their environment? And how will this perception frame and shape the world they will soon inherit and steward into the future?
But let’s face it – at 48 I&#039;m likely older than Jake&#039;s father. So is there really anything (anything at all?) that this 23 year old (or any 23 year old for that matter) could possibly teach me? Maybe I&#039;m being a snob (probably). But it&#039;s a question worth asking, isn&#039;t it? What kind of insights could such a young person possibly have that would legitimize a book of any legitimate merit or substance?
I admit to being more than pleasantly surprised by Jake -- his energy, enthusiasm and positivity is infectious. I genuinely enjoyed our conversation. It&#039;s a conversation that gives me hope for a younger generation too often preemptively written off as entitled and lazy. It&#039;s also a conversation that delves into universal subjects all people young and old should be grappling with -- how to maximize purpose and personal fulfillment; the importance of self-directed learning; the crucial role of mentorship; how to propel yourself forward in the face of fear; why it’s okay to feel different; why it’s so important to go after your dreams; and why, in the words of Jake himself, purpose is the strongest form of activism.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering. Let me know what you think in the comments below!

This is the time of year for reflection.

So let&#039;s do all those things. Welcome to the second annual Best of the RRP Anthology. This is our way of reflecting back. Our way of expressing gratitude. Our way of giving thanks for taking this journey with us.
I pride myself on bringing a wide variety of personalities, opinions and attitudes to the show. When I look back over 2014, even I am surprised by how many incredibly interesting and unique people and perspectives I was honored to entertain and share with you. Second listens brought new insights. Another reminder of what a gift this show has been to me. A gift that gives and keeps on giving.

A compendium of some of my favorite conversations of 2014, the next two episodes of the podcast are certain to catapult you into the new year inspired.
If you’ve been with me all along, these offerings will bring certain insights back into the forefront of your consciousness as you contemplate your trajectory heading into the new year. If you&#039;re new to the show, then these episodes will definitely inspire you to peruse the catalog and listen in full to some of the guests and or episodes you may have missed. Links to the full episodes excerpted in this anthology are enumerated below.
It has been an incredible year. My blessings are many. My gratitude is overflowing. This is my way way of saying thank you. I appreciate you. Here&#039;s to an extraordinary 2015 -- the year we manifest our greatest dreams into reality. Join me, and let&#039;s do this thing together.

		<itunes:summary>&quot;Everyday we have the opportunity to create a living masterpiece.&quot;
Michael Gervais


At the highest echelons of sport, all the athletes are supremely talented. All have devoted their lives to being the best they can be. All train as hard as they possibly can. And all are optimizing their sleep, nutrition and recovery to glean every extra edge imaginable.
So what distinguishes the gold medalist from the also ran?
Is it luck? Talent? Support? Resources? Of course every result is significantly influenced by some combination of these important variables. But all things being equal, the athlete with the mental and emotional edge will stand atop the podium every time.
Once the embarrassing last stop on a flailing athlete’s career, the world&#039;s top sports psychologists now enjoy a highly influential and respected role proactively honing the mental and emotional edge of today&#039;s most successful athletes, CEOs and creatives looking to elevate peak performance beyond the imaginable.
Enter Dr. Michael Gervais - the go to high performance psychologist everyone is talking about.
Director of the High Performance Psychology arm of DISC (Diagnostic and Interventional Surgical Center) Sports &amp; Spine Center in Marina Del Rey and a key member of the Red Bull High Performance Program, Michael works in the trenches of high-stakes environments, where there is no luxury for mistakes, hesitation, or failure to respond. With the vision of helping his clients thrive under pressure, Michael has created a performance model -- melding state-of-the-art brain mapping techniques with an approach grounded in high-performance psychology -- that allows people to achieve their maximum potential, whether on or off the field.
Dr. Gervais&#039; results are staggering. If you follow the NFL, then you might recall Michael as the guy Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll credits as integral in their Super Bowl win for the meditation, mindfulness and other crucial team building techniques he helped foster and instill into the fabric of the Seahawks organization and team culture that paved the team’s path towards incredible success.
You might also remember that Felix Baumgartner’s now-infamous Red Bull Stratos jump from an altitude of 128,000 feet almost never was simply because Felix simply could not overcome the high level of anxiety and claustrophobia he experienced every time he donned the jump suit. It was none other than Gervais who helped Baumagartner resolve the issue and get Stratos back on track. No Gervais, no history making jump.
In addition to the Seahawks and Red Bull&#039;s North American athletes, Dr. Gervais has worked with the US Olympic Team, snowboarders, golfers, basketball players, track and field athletes, an impressive array of top collegiate programs, and professional sports organizations including the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB and UFC. In addition, his work has played an integral role in the US Military, as well as several collegiate and high school programs.
While Dr. Gervais’ roster includes some of the sports world’s most elite, this isn’t just about high performance athletes, its about high performance life. To coin his phrase, everyday we have the opportunity to create a living masterpiece. 
So what&#039;s the secret?
The answer might surprise you. It’s not about motivation. And it’s not about winning. It’s about the way it feels to be who you are. It’s about courage. And it’s about exploring what’s possible.
I sincerely hope you enjoy this exploration of the boundaries of human potential with the sagacious and insightful Dr. Michael Gervais.

		<itunes:summary>And now for something completely different...
In an effort to create a little more intimacy, a little more community, and a little more connection with you -- the audience -- I thought I would open the show up to your burning questions. Talk about what you want to talk about for a change. A few weeks back I put the word out for question submissions and you responded -- our inbox was flooded with e-mails.
So here we are. My first spin with a Q&amp;A format. I picked a handful of queries I thought would make for an interesting and broadly applicable discussion, asked Julie to occupy the co-pilot seat (talking into a microphone alone is really hard, and not that fun) and we gave it our all to answer your questions to the best of our collective abilities.
Topics discussed and questions answered pivot around the following:

How to pursue your dream when your partner is non-supportive;
How to escape an unfulfilling career when you don&#039;t know what you really want;
How to balance physical fitness against spiritual fitness;
How to manage extended family put off by your life choices and dietary preferences; and
How to raise a healthy toddler plant-based.


Special thanks and shoutout to Jen B., Tommy F., Pete D., Dawn and Hugh for the great questions. Not sure about whether or not you want to be identified publicly, so I&#039;m going to err on the side of anonymity.
Did you guys like the episode? Is this format something you think I should I do it again? Was it too long? Too short? How about rotating guests for co-pilot duty? 
If the demand exists and I continue to get great submissions from you, then I’ll keep doing it. Maybe not every week, but we’ll see. In the interim, send your questions for an (anticipated) future episode to: findingultra@gmail.com and leave your comments below.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>IN-Q returns. It&#039;s time to question everything. It&#039;s time to get excited for now.
If you&#039;ve been on this journey with me for a while, no doubt RRP 81 seared Q into your permanent consciousness. If you’re new to the show, I strongly suggest you give that episode a listen first. Not only is it an epic conversation, it will give you some crucial context and foundation for today&#039;s mind meld.
Nonetheless, here&#039;s a quick breakdown on the impressive IN-Q curriculum vitae:
Rapper. Actor. Teacher. Songwriter, TED Talker &amp; internationally revered spoken word artist, IN-Q is a national poetry slam champion who has shared the stage with people like Barack Obama, De La Soul, Eminem, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, John Legend and even Cirque du Soleil. He has toured over 70 colleges; written songs for Miley Cyrus, Rock Mafia, Selena Gomez and Aloe Blacc and has been featured on virtually every TV network from A&amp;E to ABC, including HBO’s Def Poetry Jam and Versus &amp; Flow.
Why is a spoken word poet guesting on a health &amp; wellness podcast?
Because wellness isn&#039;t just diet, exercise and yoga mats. Someone who is truly &quot;well&quot; exudes positivity, soul, spirit, honesty, service, selflessness and integrity from their very core. IN-Q represents a life fully expressed – spreading a message of healing, love and positivity in service to others. Not only is IN-Q a man living his most authentic self, he is what I would call the very definition of health.
On January 15, for one night only, IN-Q will be performing at the beautiful Mark Taper Forum in downtown Los Angeles. It is going to be an epic evening (I&#039;ll definitely be there), so if you are in town that day I strongly suggest you pick up tickets now -- it will definitely sell out and it&#039;s a one time deal not to be missed. For tickets and additional information on this one time performance, go to in-q.com.*
If you can&#039;t make the show, then this podcast is the next best thing. IN-Q is a special guy -- touched in a very real, tactile way. I aspire to this man&#039;s openness, grace, and attitude of gratitude. It&#039;s an honor to spend time with him and I am so pleased to bring his message to you once again. An incredible storyteller, his message will leave you reevaluating your priorities, rethinking your path and ultimately indelibly changed.
As the man himself just might say: get excited for now and question everything.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation. Let me know what you think in the comments section below.
Peace + Plants,

* In full disclosure and in case you are wondering, I have zero financial involvement in this show (or in anything IN-Q does). I just love, support and believe in this guy and think everyone would be enriched by checking out his stuff.

		<itunes:summary>Welcome back for Part 2 of my conversation with Teen Whisperer Josh Shipp.
You haven&#039;t listened to Part 1 yet? Go do that first, then come on back. It will save me some explaining. But as long as we&#039;re on the subject, let&#039;s recap the situation.
Josh is a recognized teen behavior expert well known for helping adults understand teens and teens understand themselves. He’s worked with, appeared on and/or contributed to MTV, CNN, FOX, The New York Times, 20/20, Anderson Cooper Live, Oprah.com and Good Morning America. In 2009 Josh was named to Inc. magazine&#039;s &quot;30 Under 30&quot; of successful entrepreneurs. He has lectured at Harvard, Stanford, UCLA and MIT, starred in two documentary-style television series and authored two books: The Teen&#039;s Guide to World Domination and Jump Ship.
If you did listen to my intro and outro to Part 1, then you know Josh challenged me to remove e-mail and social media from my iPhone as a means of increasing my overall productivity and enhancing the quality of my interpersonal interactions. Today is day 3 and as Josh so adeptly predicts in this second part of our conversation, I am indeed twitchy. A little anxious. Scattered and basically just uncomfortable with the whole idea. Why? Because I like being connected at all times. I like the buzz and anticipation of checking social media. And I can easily justify it as part of my job. But this does not mean it&#039;s healthy because it isn&#039;t. My relationship might not fall into Her (the movie) territory, but it&#039;s definitely obsessive compulsive, if not just a downright addiction.
What does this remind me of?
Rehab.
Weathering a detox -- or in this case an iDetox -- isn&#039;t fun. But for me it&#039;s familiar territory. I know that if I stick with it, it will pass. I also know that the simple fact I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms is a pretty good indicator that I am onto something. Something I need to do if I want to grow.
Monday night I fired an e-mail off to Josh to thank him again for doing the podcast and to let him know Part 1 was live. I closed the note with the following:
&quot;P.S. - deleted Twitter, Facebook AND e-mail from my phone. Think I’m going to have a panic attack. Tell me I’ll be OK.&quot;
The next morning, Josh replied:
&quot;Imagine having Doritos and a green drink sitting in front of you. If you&#039;re new to eating clean ... you&#039;ll grab the Doritos every time, even though you know better. But when the ONLY option is the green drink, you are at first forced to go for it, but then later choose it. We should choose real humans, friends, family, etc. first. But social media is the Doritos. As sad as this is, we have slowly trained ourselves to go to real people LAST instead of first... This is a way of reprograming ourselves.&quot;
So true. I&#039;ve decided to undergo this #iDetox for me, but I also know I&#039;m not alone. This is for the millions of people out there quietly coveting smart phone addictions that are ultimately degrading the quality of their three dimensional tactile, analog lives. Their real lives. If I can do this, then so can you.

iPhone digital detox Day 3: uncomfortable, anxious, confused, disoriented, irritable. Obviously I need this. #iDetox Who’s w/ me?
— richroll (@richroll) December 10, 2014

Are you in? If so, here&#039;s what I am doing for the next 30 days -- I dare you to join me:

Delete your social media and e-mail apps from your smart phone.
On your iPhone to go: Settings &gt; General &gt; Restrictions &gt; That should be ON and you should NOT have the passcode. Let your partner or a buddy set it.
Delete the App Store. That&#039;s right. You heard me.
Set reasonable, permissible &quot;work hours&quot; for e-mail and social media (on a desktop or laptop). Do not deviate.
Openly share the ups and downs of your experience online (during prescribed &quot;work hours&quot; of course) using the hashtag #iDetox.

This is not about quitting social media or becoming some kind of technology luddite. It&#039;s simply about creating healthy boundaries around use.</itunes:summary>

This is not about quitting social media or becoming some kind of technology luddite. It's simply about creating healthy boundaries around use. It's about prioritizing real relationships over virtual ones. And it's about being more present in the life you are actually living. Let's treat this like a fun 30 day ride. An experiment undertaken together. If after 30 days we conclude we are happier, more present, and importantly more productive, then together we can assess a long-term strategy and its implications going forward.
None of us are perfect. But to echo Josh, it's these imperfections that make us human. And the pooled, communal humanity is what just might make this collective endeavor highly influential.
So let’s tap that Josh Shipp vein once again and pick up the mainline where we left off on Monday. I sincerely hope you enjoy the second part of the conversation and I encourage you to let me know what you think of it and this whole #iDetox experiment in the comments below.
 Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>The road gets narrower.
In sobriety, this phrase gets tossed around early and often. When I was new to recovery, I had no idea what these words meant. Now I catch myself reprising this mantra daily.
Translation: left to my own devices, I will unconsciously and obsessively latch onto and lose myself in almost anything that promises to remove me from myself, take me out of the moment, numb my emotions, undermine my productivity and (preferably) isolate me from other humans -- this is alcoholism.
If I want to grow, I have to be willing to let go of old habits that no longer serve me. The more sober I get, the more certain seemingly innocuous behaviors become problematic -- impediments to accessing the best version of myself. Growth requires that such behaviors constantly be assessed, addressed, modified, and in some cases discarded altogether.
For me, drugs and alcohol were obviously the first to go. But the inquiry didn&#039;t end there. When drugs and alcohol were removed from my system, my dis-ease had to find secondary behavioral weaknesses to exploit -- things like how I navigate my relationships and intimacy, how I relate to food, and even how I use television.
Changing my diet 8 years ago helped me understand the full extent to which I would use food to medicate and regulate my emotional state -- something that never previously even occurred to me. Next up was TV - a perfect way to lose myself in &quot;harmless&quot; entertainment and &quot;not feel&quot; whatever I was experiencing emotionally. So a year ago we pulled the plug on DirectTV. This was not my idea. Like giving up drugs or cheeseburgers, this was not something I wanted to do. It was something I needed to do if I wanted to continue evolving. The detox was brutal. But I can tell you now that I would never go back -- my life is way better now without the box.
The road continues to grow narrower.
My latest struggle? Owning up to the obsessive manner in which I use my iPhone to &quot;check out.&quot; What good is all the meditation and mindfulness work I have been doing if every time I have a free moment I impulsively grab my phone and start addictively scrolling through Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and e-mail? Without a doubt, its become my drug of choice. I am finally willing to admit that the compulsive nature of my relationship with my beloved device is not compatible with the man I would like to become. It&#039;s a walk that doesn&#039;t meet my talk. Things have to change.
So today -- thanks exclusively to my provocative conversation with this week&#039;s amazing guest -- I deleted Twitter, Facebook and e-mail from my iPhone.
Holy crap. If you know me, then you know this is not a small thing -- I damn near live on my phone. The detox already rivals anything I have previously endured. This fact alone validates my decision, does it not? To be clear, I&#039;m not quitting social media -- it has been and continues to be a huge and tremendously valuable part of my daily life. What I am doing is taking Josh&#039;s advice (per our conversation) and creating healthy boundaries around my use of these platforms so I can grow. The desired result? Enhanced emotional well being; a reduction in anxiety; an elevation of mindfulness; qualitative improvement in my interpersonal interactions; greater appreciation for the present moment; and last, but hardly least, increased focus and productivity.

		<fullsummary>The road gets narrower.
In sobriety, this phrase gets tossed around early and often. When I was new to recovery, I had no idea what these words meant. Now I catch myself reprising this mantra daily.
Translation: left to my own devices, I will unconsciously and obsessively latch onto and lose myself in almost anything that promises to remove me from myself, take me out of the moment, numb my emotions, undermine my productivity and (preferably) isolate me from other humans -- this is alcoholism.
If I want to grow, I have to be willing to let go of old habits that no longer serve me. The more sober I get, the more certain seemingly innocuous behaviors become problematic -- impediments to accessing the best version of myself. Growth requires that such behaviors constantly be assessed, addressed, modified, and in some cases discarded altogether.
For me, drugs and alcohol were obviously the first to go. But the inquiry didn't end there. When drugs and alcohol were removed from my system, my dis-ease had to find secondary behavioral weaknesses to exploit -- things like how I navigate my relationships and intimacy, how I relate to food, and even how I use television.

The result was miraculous, lending truth to the story Josh now tells the millions of teens that look to him for advice, insight, inspiration and guidance to take control of their lives:  
Every kid is ONE caring adult away from being a success story.
Now widely known as the Teen Whisperer, Josh is a recognized teen behavior expert that helps adults understand teens and teens understand themselves. He’s worked with, appeared on and/or contributed to MTV, CNN, FOX, The New York Times, 20/20, Anderson Cooper Live, Oprah.com and Good Morning America. In 2009 he was named to Inc. magazine's "30 Under 30" of successful entrepreneurs. Josh has lectured at Harvard, Stanford, UCLA, MIT and other major universities. He has starred in two documentary-style television series, Jump Shipp and Teen Trouble and has authored two books: The Teen's Guide to World Domination and Jump Ship. 

Heading into this interview I had a feeling Josh and I were going to hit it off. We totally did. We could have talked all day. We totally almost did that too. Therefore, I decided to break this conversation into 2 parts. I'll post Part 2 late Wednesday night (12.10.14 PST).
How did Josh find his way out? What do adults most misunderstand about teens? How can parents better communicate with their adolescents? How do you reach an emotionally withdrawn youth? How does Josh's life experience inform his own parenting? And how do you inspire a young person who simply feels he or she has nothing to offer?
According to Josh, the path from helplessness to empowerment begins with understanding that: 
Your imperfections are what make you you human.
Your humanity is what makes you influential.
What exactly does that mean? Let’s dive into Josh’s universe and find out. This conversation left me not only inspired, but actually compelled to make some important changes in my own life. May it do the same for you.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>Lots of excitement and anticipation about today’s guest. One of the most lauded, celebrated and accomplished athletes on the planet, let me introduce you to the guy who can seemingly run forever:

Dean Karnazes.
We&#039;re talking about a guy TIME magazine named one of the &quot;Top 100 Most Influential People in the World.&quot; Men&#039;s Fitness magazine hailed him as one of the fittest men on the planet. An internationally recognized endurance athlete, NY Times bestselling author, in demand public speaker, and successful entrepreneur, Dean has pushed his body, mind and spirit to places most people simply cannot fathom.

To give you an idea of what Dean is all about, let&#039;s briefly run through a few of his ridiculous mind-bending running accomplishments:


Ran 350 miles in under 81 hours foregoing sleep for 3 days;
Ran a marathon in each of the 50 states in 50 consecutive days;
On 11 occasions, ran a 200 mile relay race solo, racing alongside teams of 12;
Won the 4 Desert Race Series in 2008, traversing the Gobi, Antacara, Sahara and Antarctica;
Won the Badwater 135 in 2004 and has run this race 10 times;
Ran 148 miles on a treadmill in 24 hours; and
Ran 3000 miles across the US from Disneyland to NYC in 75 days, running 40-50 miles / day

Given all of these feats of astounding endurance and more, Dean is widely lauded as one of the greatest athletes of our time -- an accolade deserved if you ask me.
But it wasn&#039;t alway this way. After success on the track in high school, Dean put running in his rear view in favor of business. But by age 30, he found himself at a spiritual crossroads. Dissatisfied with the successful, comfortable life he had built for himself, he yearned for something more. He yearned for challenge. He yearned for discomfort. He yearned for struggle. Because to struggle is to be alive.
After a now famous drunken all night run following his 30th birthday party, the rest is well documented running history. Dean chronicles his discovery and love of running in his bestselling memoir Ultramarathon Man -- a must read for anyone who loves an inspirational story of adversity and personal triumph -- and his journey continues in his follow up tomes 50/50, and Run! Not enough? Dean is currently hard at work on a new book – a novelized look at the amazing life of Pheidippedes, the legendary Greek who ran from Marathon to Athens to deliver news of a military victory against the Persians, a subject close to Dean’s heart given his Greek heritage.
How does Dean do it? Some chalk it up to genetics – a freakishly high lactate threshold; an unnaturally high tolerance for pain; and an unusual ability to tolerate sleep deprivation Setting aside debate on whether these mental and physiological data points are earned or inherited, I feel compelled to say that the answer to this question is far more complex. And far more interesting.
I first met Dean very briefly back at a trade show back in 2011. In 2012, he was gracious enough to give me a very kind endorsement blurb for my book Finding Ultra. But I can’t honestly say I really knew the man. Then, out of the blue, he sent me short, cryptic email in early 2013:
Dean: Any desire to spend a few relaxing days out in Death Valley this summer?
Me: Are you asking me what I think you’re asking me?
Indeed he was. A formal invite to help support Dean&#039;s 10th assault on the legendary Badwater 135 -- widely considered the world&#039;s toughest footrace. It was an offer I simply could not refuse.
Beyond the honor, it was an extraordinary experience (for my first-hand account, check out my podcast chat with Josh Spector last year – episode #40). I have to say I was in over my head on this one – I simply hadn’t been training that much at the time -- but I am so grateful for the experience, one I won&#039;t soon forget. Myself, along with Jason Koop, Brendan Freise and Nathan Peerbolt spent 24 hours pacing Dean across Death Valley and up the Mt. Whitney portals.</itunes:summary>

Myself, along with Jason Koop, Brendan Freise and Nathan Peerbolt spent 24 hours pacing Dean across Death Valley and up the Mt. Whitney portals. My personal highlight was running alongside Dean through a huge portion of the night straight through to daybreak. Despite the pain he endured, Dean found the wherewithal to talk to me at length about everything -- running, writing, marriage, family, business and just everyday life.
When the sun rose, I felt like I knew the real Dean.
Over the course of that 24 hour race, I saw Dean sail and I saw him struggle. I observed how he handled incredible duress and extraordinary suffering in 130 F temperatures unfit for humans. I witnessed how patience and experience and faith and sheer determination got him through the countless tough spots, the dark abyss and ultimately across the Badwater finish line for the 10th time. And not for nothing, in the days before and after the race I took note of how he navigates his fame and popularity with gentlemanly presence, grace and gratitude.

I consider this man to be one of the great champions of our time. A true role model. An inspiration to me personally and to millions worldwide. And someone I am lucky to call both a mentor and a friend.
So what makes Dean Karnazes the most successful ultra-distance runner on Earth? Now in his 50’s, how has Dean's perspective on nutrition evolved? After accomplishing so much, what continues to drive him? How is he able to run such great distances seemingly without fatigue? And how does he successfully balance his running with his philanthropic endeavors, raising kids, maintaining a healthy marriage, running a successful business, his countless speaking engagements, appearances and travel commitments?
Well, let’s find out. I sincerely hope you enjoy this week's conversation.
Peace + Plants,

P.S. This is a special week. We just celebrated the show’s 2 year anniversary and we just surpassed 4 million total podcast downloads! Wow. That's a lot of downloads. I don’t know what to say. I’m elated, happy, grateful and humbled more than you know. Appropriate given the import of this particular holiday weekend. If you’ve been with me from the start, you are familiar with our humble beginnings. I launched this thing with no attachment to the result. My expectations for all of this were zero. I just felt this urge to continue the conversation that Finding Ultra had started by sharing some of the people, information, knowledge, inspiration and tools that have been so helpful to me along this path. I’m blown away by what the show has become and can’t thank all of you enough for all the passion, support and for, well, just being an incredible audience. All I can say is that I promise to keep getting better at this – upping my game – and will do everything in my power to bring you the best people and information I can. Anyway, just a long winded thanks -- you guys are awesome.

		<itunes:summary>Prepare thyself, because ready or not, the holiday season is indeed upon us.  
For most, this is that special time of year when -- whether by conscious choice or simply due to external circumstance -- we find ourselves overeating, overspending and simply overindulging in anything and everything, all in the name of celebratory merriment. When we&#039;re not charging it on the card or spread paper thin desperately trying to fulfill all the heightened expectations this time of year presents, we find ourselves weathering an unnatural battery of social engagements and the emotionally hyper-charged land mines presented by extended family get togethers.
The result?  A massive and unnatural outpouring of energy that leaves us not just out of balance, but utterly depleted -- spit out the other side physically and emotionally exhausted to the core, all too often overweight and riddled with unnecessary debt. 
Then what? We awake on New Year&#039;s Day committed to do and be better next time -- the annual renewal ritual that inevitably falls short. A slow burn leading up to next November to repeat the cycle.
The standard American approach to the holidays is unhealthy, out of balance, verging on lunacy.

Let&#039;s have a different experience. Let&#039;s relax. Let&#039;s make sure we&#039;re exercising self-care. Let&#039;s focus on the giving part. And let&#039;s not over extend ourselves financially, emotionally or physically so we can emerge in January not just intact but truly enriched -- optimistic, feeling great and energized for all the challenges and adventures presented with the birth of a new year.

As we did last November (RRP 60), this week Julie and I once again sit down to hash out all things holiday season with a focus on providing helpful, experience-based strategies to assist in managing the financial pitfalls, dietary challenges, precarious social environments and heightened emotional states presented by this unique time of year. In my experience, these are issues common to us all. And yet issues we go to great lengths to avoid dealing with internally, let alone discussing outwardly -- typically out of fear, shame or simply a profound need to keep up appearances -- all of which ultimately leaves us feeling alone and isolated in what for many can become a state of true emotional crisis. In truth, the exact opposite of what the holidays should be all about.
So rather than deny or repress, let&#039;s talk about it. Let&#039;s get it all out in the open. And let&#039;s work on a strategy for a better, more positive and uplifting experience. On today&#039;s agenda:

How to avoid spending money you don&#039;t have;
How to maintain a healthy diet throughout the season;
How to experience gift giving with children in a different way;
How to navigate and avoid emotional land mines with extended family;
How to say &quot;No&quot; to certain social obligations; and
How to nurture and preserve your physical, emotional &amp; spiritual well being under pressure.

Many of the topics raised and discussed in this conversation are beautifully and concretely laid out in this very helpful companion piece by Julie entitled &quot;How To Maintain Emotional &amp; Financial Sanity During the Holidays&quot; - well worth checking out.
It&#039;s about self-care people. You simply cannot expect to be able to show up, be your best self and be there for others if you are not first taking care of yourself. This is not selfish -- it&#039;s truth. And a crucial huge component of this success equation begins and ends with meditation. To learn more about Julie&#039;s guided program discussed during the episode, click here.
In addition, we also have a few delicious plant-based recipes up on the site - healthy alternatives to the the expected standard fare. Try &#039;em out, bring one or more to your next gathering and enjoy!

		<fullsummary>Prepare thyself, because ready or not, the holiday season is indeed upon us.  
For most, this is that special time of year when -- whether by conscious choice or simply due to external circumstance -- we find ourselves overeating, overspending and simply overindulging in anything and everything, all in the name of celebratory merriment. When we're not charging it on the card or spread paper thin desperately trying to fulfill all the heightened expectations this time of year presents, we find ourselves weathering an unnatural battery of social engagements and the emotionally hyper-charged land mines presented by extended family get togethers.
The result?  A massive and unnatural outpouring of energy that leaves us not just out of balance, but utterly depleted -- spit out the other side physically and emotionally exhausted to the core, all too often overweight and riddled with unnecessary debt. 
Then what? We awake on New Year's Day committed to do and be better next time -- the annual renewal ritual that inevitably falls short. A slow burn leading up to next November to repeat the cycle.
The standard American approach to the holidays is unhealthy, out of balance, verging on lunacy.

Let's have a different experience. Let's relax. Let's make sure we're exercising self-care. Let's focus on the giving part. And let's not over extend ourselves financially, emotionally or physically so we can emerge in January not just intact but truly enriched -- optimistic, feeling great and energized for all the challenges and adventures presented with the birth of a new year.

As we did last November (RRP 60), this week Julie and I once again sit down to hash out all things holiday season with a focus on providing helpful, experience-based strategies to assist in managing the financial pitfalls, dietary challenges, precarious social environments and heightened emotional states presented by this unique time of year. In my experience, these are issues common to us all. And yet issues we go to great lengths to avoid dealing with internally, let alone discussing outwardly -- typically out of fear, shame or simply a profound need to keep up appearances -- all of which ultimately leaves us feeling alone and isolated in what for many can become a state of true emotional crisis. In truth, the exact opposite of what the holidays should be all about.
So rather than deny or repress, let's talk about it. Let's get it all out in the open. And let's work on a strategy for a better, more positive and uplifting experience. On today's agenda:

How to avoid spending money you don't have;
How to maintain a healthy diet throughout the season;
How to experience gift giving with children in a different way;
How to navigate and avoid emotional land mines with extended family;
How to say "No" to certain social obligations; and
How to nurture and preserve your physical, emotional &amp; spiritual well being under pressure.

Many of the topics raised and discussed in this conversation are beautifully and concretely laid out in this very helpful companion piece by Julie entitled "How To Maintain Emotional &amp; Financial Sanity During the Holidays" - well worth checking out.
It's about self-care people. You simply cannot expect to be able to show up, be your best self and be there for others if you are not first taking care of yourself. This is not selfish -- it's truth.

This Week's Assignment: If your past experiences with the holidays have left you emotionally, physically and or financially depleted, approach this holiday season with a firm belief that you can have a better experience. Place emphasis on self-care first. Make it a top priority to do what you need to each morning to create balance for the remainder of the day -- good food, meditation, exercise. Simple, right? In theory yes. But in practice it can be tricky with all the pressures the holidays bring. So put it first, and watch your experience improve -- for you and everyone you care for.
Weekly Q&amp;A: Finally, I am considering adding a second show each week (or maybe every other week) in which I engage you -- the audience -- more directly by answering the specific questions you want answered. So I'm going to run an experiment (a "beta test" for you techies). Send me your thoughts and questions and issues and topics -- the things you would like me to address on the show -- to findingultra@gmail.com. I will sift through the queries, pull out a handful and put together an episode in which I address, discuss and answer what you want to hear me talk about. Deal? Deal.
I sincerely hope you enjoy this week's offering. Happy Thanksgiving!
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>I’m obsessed with the idea that we can all do and be better. That&#039;s what this show is about -- a loud and clear call to action. A graceful nudge to help anyone and everyone not just understand, but actually believe that we are all capable of so much more than we often allow ourselves to accept.

Enter David Clark.
It’s fun to interview the celebrated. But quite honestly there is just something far more personally gratifying about sharing the story of an anonymous, everyman hero. What truly moves and inspires me are tales of regular people with regular problems who courageously meet severe challenges head on; do something unexpected and astounding that strains the boundaries of what we imagine possible; and come out the other side transformed with life lessons that can benefit us all.
Much like my conversation with Josh LaJaunie (RRP #63 is a must listen if you haven’t already and in my top-5 most downloaded shows), this interview will move you. It will touch you. It will erase whatever obstacles and excuses you rely on that perpetuate bad habits, keep you stuck and reinforce denial. My sincere hope is that David&#039;s story will help you really get that no matter what your circumstances or environment, that you always hold the power to implement personal change that can profoundly alter the trajectory of your life -- beyond your wildest imagination even.
I was first introduced to David by my friend Mishka Shubaly (another RRP fave with a shocking 5 appearances on the show). I didn’t know anything about him, but when Mishka says he&#039;s worth investigating, I investigate.
I winced at photos of a guy pushing 320 pounds, prematurely aged, red-faced and bloated, cocktail in hand. I know an alcoholic when I see one, and this image of David cut a little too close to home. A guy who looked like hell, red lining towards death without a care while wrecking havoc, destruction and woe in the lives of loved ones and anyone and who happened to cross his path.
Then I saw a picture of a fit and slim 165 pound athlete crossing the finish line at insane ultra-marathons like the Leadville 100 and Badwater – a 135 mile run across Death Valley in 130-degree July heat -- widely considered to be the world’s two toughest footraces.
The 320+ pound guy, who looked like some kind of menacing Archie Bunker-esque uncle you’re scared to talk to bore almost no resemblance to that runner achieving things that would impress even the most accomplished marathoners. To say that I was amazed by the astounding extent to which he had seemingly transformed his life would be an understatement. My first thought was, can this be real? 
But when I looked closely, it was undeniable. It was indeed the same guy.
I needed to know more. I needed to know how he did it. So I reached out to David and he sent me his self-published memoir, Out There: A Story of Ultra Recovery. After reading the first page, I knew I had to have him on the show.
David’s is the story of a man who never had a chance to find out who he was. Growing up in the hardest of circumstances, poor, homeless, without any formal education and traveling the country in his father’s pickup truck, he&#039;s a kid who grew up no stranger to the hard knocks of life. This book is a no-holds barred, at times quite painful personal account of what it’s really like to be obese. What it really feels like to be an alcoholic in the firm grips of disease without hope of escape. Spiraling toward death, spending years eating recklessly, drinking and drugging himself, David grew farther and farther away from everyone around him until he found himself completely alone. Desperate. Broken. In a fleeting moment of clarity, a thought occurred to him:

“If I don’t change today, I will die.”



Ultimately Dave had enough. Pulling from deep reserves, he somehow found the wherewithal to finally face and overcome his demons, transform his life wholesale and ultimately accomplish feats most sane people would deem impossible.</itunes:summary>

Ultimately Dave had enough. Pulling from deep reserves, he somehow found the wherewithal to finally face and overcome his demons, transform his life wholesale and ultimately accomplish feats most sane people would deem impossible. First he recovered from a death-sentence addiction to drugs and alcohol that destroyed his career, his family and nearly his life. Then he overcame a life-long addiction to unhealthy foods &amp; lifestyle habits to discover a healthy (now plant-based) way of living. Hand in hand with his life overhaul came a deep passion for running.
When he began, David could only run 15 seconds before having to stop, out of breath. But he persisted. And the results are staggering. He didn't just drop 150 pounds. He didn't just complete a half-marathon. He didn't just complete a marathon. And he didn't just finish the Badwater 135, but a whole slew of impressive ultra-marathons, including a stab at the 12-hour treadmill run world record. Today, David is a loving father of three, a running coach, sponsored runner, speaker, and a gym owner. And the running odyssey continues. Just today he texted me to let me in on a new challenge - he intends to run the Boston Marathon 4-times in a row to honor the memory of a young girl that passed away this year!
Not enough? David dedicates his remaining free time to The Superman Project, a vehicle he created to help others and further share his story of how we can all change everything about ourselves if we want it badly enough.

This week I am beyond pleased to give Dave a well-deserved microphone to serve this powerful message. So just how did he do it? Tune in and find out.
I sincerely hope you enjoy this week's offering.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>You could say this show has been on a bit of a plant-based tear lately, and this week it continues with with my friend Bryant Terry – eco-chef, cookbook author, educator and most interesting to me, a renown social justice activist focused on promoting and healthy, just, affordable and sustainable food systems for all people – particularly the underprivileged living in underserved urban communities. His goal? To foster awareness, promote change and create opportunities for people living in urban food deserts -- places where fresh, healthy, sustainable food is difficult or impossible to obtain.
Why? Because good food should be an everyday right -- not a privilege.
Bryant’s got a slew of really beautiful cookbooks that fuse his Memphis family roots and the traditions of true southern African American cooking with art, music, literature a modern plant-based perspective. His most recent offering, Afro Vegan was named one of the &quot;Best Cookbooks of 2014&quot;  by Amazon.com and his critically acclaimed Vegan Soul Kitchen was named one of the best vegetarian/vegan cookbooks of the last 25 years by Cooking Light Magazine.
Bryant’s work has been featured in The New York Times, Food and Wine, Gourmet, Sunset, Oprah Magazine and Essence and he has appeared on The Martha Stewart Show, Emeril, All Things COnsidered, Morning Edition, The Splendid Table, and The Tavis Smiley Show. In addition, Bryant has deleivered keynote addresses at countless events and on college campuses including Brown, Columbia, NYU, Smith, Stanford and Yale.
In addition, TheRoot.com included him on its list of “100 most influential African Americans,” and Ebony magazine listed him on its annual “Power 100” list.
Still not impressed? On top of everything else, Bryant is also the 2014 Artist in Residence at San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral, where he is curating interesting gatherings with an eye towards promoting deeper community roots.
I could go on – Bryant&#039;s accolades are many – but you get the idea. This guy is so much more than a chef and cookbook author. Behind the affable disposition and congenial smile, Bryant is a true progressive; a boundary pushing, paradigm breaking community-minded advocate passionately devoted to promoting better access to healthful, affordable foods for urban African American and minority communities and tackling the industrialized food system that has made it far too easy for these economically challenged communities to shirk healthy habits in favor of cheap meat and the convenience of fast food.
Bryant delivers the goods on multiple levels and this is an awesome conversation. A dialog that starts with food as the common thread that unites us all and veers into food politics, the economic aspects of food choice, food as a platform to create better communities and food as a vehicle for social justice.
I sincerely hope this week&#039;s offering. Let me know what you think in the comments section below.
Peace + Plants,

PS - Make sure you listen all the way to the end or you&#039;ll miss Bryant&#039;s best KRS-One impersonation!
PPS - The above image of Bryant and me was taken prior to the Minneapolis &#039;Pointergate&#039; scandal, but it does sort of serve as an unintentional social commentary on the issue, particularly in light of our conversation about &#039;Thug Kitchen.&quot;

Behind the affable disposition and congenial smile, Bryant is a true progressive; a boundary pushing, paradigm breaking community-minded advocate passionately devoted to promoting better access to healthful, affordable foods for urban African American and minority communities and tackling the industrialized food system that has made it far too easy for these economically challenged communities to shirk healthy habits in favor of cheap meat and the convenience of fast food.
Bryant delivers the goods on multiple levels and this is an awesome conversation. A dialog that starts with food as the common thread that unites us all and veers into food politics, the economic aspects of food choice, food as a platform to create better communities and food as a vehicle for social justice.
I sincerely hope this week's offering. Let me know what you think in the comments section below.
Peace + Plants,

PS - Make sure you listen all the way to the end or you'll miss Bryant's best KRS-One impersonation!
PPS - The above image of Bryant and me was taken prior to the Minneapolis 'Pointergate' scandal, but it does sort of serve as an unintentional social commentary on the issue, particularly in light of our conversation about 'Thug Kitchen."

		<itunes:summary>Confession time.
I’m the first to admit that my initial reasons for adopting a plant-based lifestyle were selfish. I was overweight. I felt lousy. I looked lousy. I had a health scare. Basically, I just wanted to look and feel better. I wanted to enjoy my kids at their energy level. I wasn’t ready to succumb to middle age defeat.
So I took the leap. A leap without much expectation I might add.
Then the miracle. I dropped 50 pounds. My vitality returned. That long-gone youthful glow restored. I didn&#039;t just get my life back, I got an entirely new one. Today I am living the life beyond my wildest dreams.
I could have never predicted the journey that would follow this simple decision. It has been long, at times hard, but ultimately extraordinary in every way imaginable. It&#039;s not an understatement that everything in my life has changed for the better. And for that I am extremely grateful.
There is one thing I know with certainty. If you want a great life, give more than you receive. This is primary reason behind my decision to start this podcast -- to share with you the people, information, tools and inspiration that have been so incredibly transformative in my life.
But let&#039;s be honest. I didn&#039;t get into this plant-based lifestyle because I wanted to save the animals. Frankly, my concern for the health of the planet could be characterized as passive lip service at best. I was the furthest thing from a food activist. And when it came to environmental, ethical and political issues like GMO’s, the deleterious effects of factory farming, slaughterhouse conditions, carbon emissions, the deforestation of the rainforests, species extinction, the mistreatment of circus animals, the pollution and overfishing of our oceans and the moral implications of harvesting animals for food, the truth is that I didn&#039;t really give it much thought.
That was then. But this is now.
In the eight years since I began this journey, I have changed. I have grown. Ever so slowly, my eyes have started to open to a myriad of uncomfortable realities relating to how our world functions. Unpleasant and unnecessary realities that I can no longer in good conscience turn a blind eye to.
I’ve been blessed with a platform. My book and this podcast have given me an audience. With this comes a certain responsibility that I take seriously.
What is that responsibility? I can&#039;t say that I’m entirely sure. However, I do know that it entails a commitment to the truth. A commitment to shed light on and help raise awareness around issues that affect not just me, but all of us. Things that are not right. Things that need to change.
The truth isn’t always comfortable. It&#039;s generally not convenient. And often not popular because it challenges us to think differently and in many cases modify behaviors we might not want to modify.
To me, the truth also presents a growth opportunity. An opportunity to be bold. To do and be better. I know can do better. And if this podcast isn’t about that, then it&#039;s just wasted air.
Our fast-paced, hyper-industrialized world lives in a comfortable haze of convenience priority. We go about our day happily and for the most part unconsciously disconnected from the process undertaken to bring consumer products into our homes. This includes the clothes we wear, the devices we use and of course the foods we enjoy.
This is process I really don&#039;t want to look at. It&#039;s uncomfortable because it forces me to transcend denial and truly consider what actually goes on behind the shroud of obfuscation erected by giant conglomerates, powerful lobbying efforts and governmental forces that have a strong vested interest in maintaining the disconnect that cloaks the public from certain unpalatable realities.
Dismantling the disconnect isn&#039;t fun. Certainly not as fun as riding my bike. Given a choice, and in my earlier incarnation, I’d be the first to look the other way and go happily about my day, irked by anyone presumptive enough to challenge my chimera of</itunes:summary>

Dismantling the disconnect isn't fun. Certainly not as fun as riding my bike. Given a choice, and in my earlier incarnation, I’d be the first to look the other way and go happily about my day, irked by anyone presumptive enough to challenge my chimera of comfortable ideals.
But I can't live that way anymore. Because delusion, ignorance and consumer malaise have become more uncomfortable to me than the truth. In recovery, they say “the road gets narrower.” I didn’t used to know what that means.
Now I do. This is what this week's show is all about. 
A veteran of the animal rights movement, and this week's guest, Lisa Lange is Executive Vice President of PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). She has coordinated the production of some of PETA’s most popular and successful videos and PSAs and works closely with celebrity PETA supporters, including Alec Baldwin, Bill Maher, Charlize Theron, Eva Mendes, and Casey Affleck. She also networks with Hollywood directors, producers, and writers, convincing them to incorporate positive animal messages into TV programs and movies.
A gifted debater, Lisa is a regular guest on The O’Reilly Factor and has debated animal rights opponents on Today, CNBC, Nancy Grace, Larry King Live, Your World With Neil Cavuto, and countless other television and radio networks and programs. She has appeared many times on entertainment shows—such as Entertainment Tonight and CNN’s Showbiz Tonight—and on E! to discuss PETA’s work in Hollywood. Her efforts to save animals have made headlines in major publications throughout the country, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, and USA Today.
Again, I have never been a vocal animal rights activist. And I wasn’t sure I was all that comfortable with some of the tactics undertaken by PETA to raise awareness. Why? Because they challenged me to think about issues I didn't really want to think about. But Lisa - a friend as well as an avid and accomplished triathlete in her own right -- has been instrumental in my own personal evolution, helping me grapple with, better understand and ultimately embrace the bigger issues at play. 
Being comfortable is lazy. Being comfortable is at odds with growth. And more often that not, being comfortable flies in the face of truth. Personal truth. And truth that affects all of us. And by all, I mean every living thing.
So today I’m owning it. Shining a light on uncomfortable, inconvenient realities I feel I cannot ignore -- the terrible and inexcusable plight suffered by the billions of helpless animals that are abused, tortured and mistreated as cogs in the massive wheel that is our industrialized food system. A system that is beyond untenable, utterly unsustainable, unequivocally unethical and unfathomably destructive to our environment (I know -- that's a lot of "u-words"). 
Intended to challenge your comfort zone, this conversation is about what we vote for when we go to the circus, buy clothes and purchase food. It's a discussion about values. Simply put, ignorance isn’t cool. And how we spend our hard earned dollars is important. Because each dollar spent is a reflection of our values. It represents a vote for who we are and what we stand for. And that vote – as small and as insignificant and disenfranchised as you might feel it to be – actually is important. A vote we can collectively leverage to forge a better world for ourselves, our children and future generations. 
Even if you are someone with a negative preconception of the animal rights movement, I implore you to set aside those notions and enter into this conversation with an open mind.
Because contempt prior to investigation is tantamount to willful ignorance.
At our core, I truly believe we are all compassionate beings. True strength means embracing that core value. And there is something about that that is just downright cool.
So let’s do something different. Let’s own it.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation. Let me know what you think in the comments below.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>This show is about chasing dreams. Making stuff happen. Helping others. And sharing the journey.
We can all use a little education. Some solid information. And a dose of experience-based inspiration to guide our own path towards self-betterment. My goal is to help you see and understand that we are generally our own self-limiter. That we are all capable of being better and doing more, irrespective of circumstances. That we all have a more authentic self lying dormant within yearning to be more self-expressed.
We owe it to ourselves to fertilize that seed. Why?

Because life is short.
Trite? yes. Cheesy? definitely. But nonetheless oh so true. Right now I&#039;m up in Palo Alto at Stanford University for my 25th Reunion. 25 years since I graduated from college. How is that possible? Translation: I am old.
Old is a mindset. Another lame idiom I choose to believe. Honestly, I feel like I am about 28. But this weekend made me acutely aware of the fleeting and transitory nature of our lives.
It seems like yesterday I was in school with all these amazing people with whom I spent the last few days reconnecting and reminiscing. People that have ventured forth to do extraordinary things like found billion dollar startups; create non-profits that have helped millions; and launch movements that have forever altered how we think and live.
This not hyperbole. This is Stanford -- a place; an institution; and a mindset that fosters the ethos that truly anything is possible. That you should challenge authority. That you must question the status quo. It&#039;s a culture that empowers the philosophy that not only can you change the world, but that it’s in fact your responsibility.
This weekend I was surrounded by people who have done and are doing just that. I am tremendously grateful for the experience. And it left me inspired to do and be better.
25 years, man. Life is short. There is no time for idleness. There is no time to equivocate.
Speaking of eradicating limitations, today marks the return of my ultrarunning buddy Josh Spector – if you are a long-time listener you will recall our conversation from last year, recounting our respective experiences crewing for Dean Karnazes and Ray Sanchez at the Badwater 135 (RRP 40).

Widely accepted as the &quot;World&#039;s Toughest Foot Race&quot;, Badwater is a 135 mile running race across Death Valley -- the hottest place on Earth -- where temperatures average 120+ in July and can reach as high as 130 with pavements temps typically in the 170-180 degree range. Starting at Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level, approximately 100 invitation-only runners from across the globe begin a jaunt that takes them across bleak and scorching desert terrain as well as three formidable mountain passes, including the culminating 13-mile ascent up the portals of Mt. Whitney -- the highest peak in the lower 48 -- to finish at 8,300 feet.


This past summer, and for the first time, Josh stepped up his game and ran the legendary -- but recently revised -- race himself.

This week&#039;s show is a rare peek behind the curtain at exactly what it takes to prepare for, endure and complete one of the most difficult running challenges on the planet – a race that requires and demonstrates a most incredible display of the indomitable nature of the human spirit.

Josh is a great guy. A humble guy. Sharing his experience is powerful because he isn’t Dean Karnazes. He isn&#039;t a professional athlete. Josh is just a normal dude who had a dream. A regular guy who fell in love with running. Put the work in brick by brick and day by day. Bided his time. Toiled patiently and relentlessly in obscurity. Invested in the journey. And experienced what it&#039;s like when all the hard work pays off, culminating in an extraordinary accomplishment. An accomplishment I’m sure just a few years ago he would have imagined was not just beyond his reach, but impossible.

		<itunes:summary>I say it all the time. Change is not an overnight miracle, people. I know there&#039;s nothing like the neatly packaged narrative of the overnight success story, but honestly that’s just well, not that honest.
The truth is that long-lasting, sustainable personal growth is never instantaneous. It’s messy. Non-linear. Two steps backwards for every step in the right direction. It’s forged out of self-experimentation, research, discomfort, failure, courage, and all too often a lot of stumbling around in the dark.
The point? It’s not a clean line. We don’t have to hold on to this perfectionist ideal. In fact, it’s this ideal that generally hold us back. Paralyzes us. Or leads to self-defeatism when we fall short of idealized goals.
When I began the process of repairing my health, I made a million mistakes. Slipped up countless times. And when I committed to getting fit, Ultraman didn&#039;t even qualify as a fantasy because I had never heard of it. I just wanted to be able to run a mile. Goals and success came later. I was able to get off the dime because I just started. Implicit in this was the permission I gave myself to fail.
Let go of perfection. Whether the change you seek is related to diet, fitness, career, finances, education or some specific skill set, the important thing is to allow yourself to just begin, and begin messy. You don’t have to know where anything is leading. You don’t have to change evertything overnight. And the steps you take don’t have to be plotted, overthought or even pretty. But you do have to start.
Or as today’s guest suggests, Lean In…
My friend Kathy Freston is a 4-time New York Times bestselling author of The Lean, Veganist, Quantum Wellness and Quantum Wellness Cleanse. She has appeared frequently on national television, including The Oprah Winfrey Show, Ellen, The Dr. Oz Show, The View, Good Morning America, Charlie Rose, The Martha Stewart Show, and Extra. Her work has been featured notably in Vanity Fair, Harper’s Bazaar, Self, W, and Fitness. In addition, she is a regular contributor to her pal Ariana Huffington&#039;s publication, Huffington Post.
Back in 2011, it was Kathy’s appearance on Oprah that inspired the great Ms. Winfrey herself – and her entire staff of 378 -- to go entirely vegan for 21 days.
In January 2014, Kathy famously launched a Change.org petition campaign urging McDonald&#039;s to debut a vegetarian menu item, a petition that went viral with over 106,000 supporters and very well may lead to the desired outcome. This is a great example of Kathy&#039;s approach of working with the system to catalyze change and disrupt status quo paradigms.
I met the delightful and beautiful Ms. Freston several years ago and always wanted to have her on the show. What I like about her is her very easy going, accessible approach to helping people make long-lasting sustainable shifts in their diet and lifestyle – everything about her style is very inviting, grounded and understanding of the stressors and limiters that envelop living a modern busy life. Hence her coined term, and the title of her most recent book, The Lean. 
Another way of saying progress, not perfection.
Today we sit down and hash out her personal journey, what led her to becoming one of the most visible, prominent and persuasive voices in the plant-based movement, and effective strategies we can all leverage to develop a healthier, happier, more plantpowered approach to diet and life.
I sincerely hope you enjoy this lean into the world of Kathy Freston. Let me know what you think of the conversation in the comments below.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>Life throws all of us obstacles. Everyone meets barriers. Nobody is immune from setbacks. It’s how we confront and navigate past the curve balls life throws that moulds character and ultimately defines who we really are.
Do you crumble or rise to the challenge? Do you shrink down and become the victim? Or do you stand tall and walk through adversity like a warrior?
And what do you do if everything just goes to shit?
You are hard pressed to find a man who has met so much adversity with such a grounded sense of purpose and honest willingness to share about it as Mark Miller.
Meet Fightshark. Just make sure you check your grousing at the door.
Born with both Type-1 Diabetes and a congenital heart defect (CHD), Mark was reared by the back hand of an alcoholic abusive father. A World War II vet and notable professional athlete who played in the very fist NBA game ever, &quot;Moose&quot; Miller was a domineering force of nature who experienced the world as a dark, unfair and often violent place – and made sure he prepared his son accordingly.
To escape the emotional and physical violence that greeted him at home, Mark immersed himself in the world of sports at a very young age. Thrown into a boxing gym at age 6, he quickly adapted, eventually mastering every sport imaginable by the time he finished high school. During his free time he worked in the Pittsburgh Steelers locker room (from age six through high school), grabbing towels, taking grief and learning about sport and life from the hand of legends like Lynn Swann, Mel Blount, Jack Ham and Mean Joe Greene while also working on his pitching with guys like Barry Bonds. All champions that in some sense served surrogate dad duty for this evolving teen.
By the time he was 18, Mark was poised to go professional as a major league pitcher. But Mark had other plans – he wanted to become a professional kickboxer.
By 2007, Mark was a rising star in this emerging sport  until a routine physical uncovered a serious cardiac condition that required open-heart surgery to replace his aortic valve.
The crisis helped to temporarily reunite his fractured family. But everybody thought Mark&#039;s fighting days were over. Once again, Mark had other plans -- the surgery just made him more determined than ever to return to the kickboxing ring. Astounded by the rapid rate at which Mark&#039;s heart healed, his doctors gave him the green light to resume training. Everything in Mark&#039;s life seemed to be getting back on track.
But 2008 had little respect for Mark&#039;s plans.
Over the course of that year, Mark lost both his parents and his drug addict brother to an overdose. A confluence of events that led Mark to lose himself in drugs and alcohol, culminating in a boozy accident that hurled his already fractured and fragile body through a car windshield and onto hard unforgiving Austin, Texas pavement.
Eventually, Mark found the wherewithal to get and stay sober. Renewed, he set his sights once again on his kickboxing comeback. Despite being labeled damaged goods, in 2011 Mark returned to the ring in Moscow and shocked the fight world when he took out one of the world’s best with a knockout in just 8 seconds.
To this day, Fightshark is the first and only combat sport athlete to return to competition after undergoing open heart surgery.
Fast forward to 2013. Just prior to his fight debut in storied Madison Square Garden, Mark contracted pneumonia, which set in motion a devastating domino effect of health cataclysms that have left him with chronic kidney failure, blindness in one eye, and the need for not one but three organ transplants: heart, pancreas and kidney.
Mark is currently fighting for his life. Literally.
In unapologetic fashion, Mark chronicles the insanity of his life and adventures in his truly compelling, raw, at times sad and yet completely engrossing new book Pain Don’t Hurt. It&#039;s a story of incredible tenacity, dedication, and hard work. It&#039;s a sincere and earnest tale of family, fatherhood,</itunes:summary>

It's a story of incredible tenacity, dedication, and hard work. It's a sincere and earnest tale of family, fatherhood, and the hard lessons about masculinity and violence learned from his father. And it's a deeply personal tribute to the never-say-die spirit embodied in a man who refuses to back down, no matter the odds.
Even if you don’t care at all for kickboxing, the UFC or anything having to do with MMA, you will be hard pressed not to be riveted by Mark’s astounding tale of superhuman resiliency and what it truly takes to meet and weather adversity on the grandest scale.
It was an honor to sit down with Mark, a man poised to inspire millions. So quit your whining and let’s step into the ring for a few rounds with the one and only Fightshark.
I hope you enjoy the conversation.
Peace + Plants,

Food is a super important aspect of this process. I believe it’s the best place to begin the process of transforming your life. But it’s also easy to get overly caught up in the dogmatic aspects of diet and nutrition. Unnecessarily boxed in by labels. Overly focused on details and minutiae. This presents a treacherous social, political and internal minefield that can result in truncating long-term growth potential. Because when we obsess on our plate at the exclusion of objectively redressing the many other very important areas of our lives that warrant focus and attention, our overall development towards full actualization is arrested.

I didn&#039;t clean up my diet so I could get stuck pontificating on the various types of dark leafy greens until all my friends fled for the hills. I cleaned up my diet so I could raise my energy levels, shift my consciousness and direct my newfound lease on life towards continual growth and expansion. A search for greater meaning, purpose and answers that will hopefully occupy me for the remainder of my days here on Earth.

Optimal nutrition based on plant-based foods is a great step in the direction of optimal wellness.. But that is all that it is -- a step. Hardly the be-all-end-all. Because wellness encompasses so much more than food. Far from the end of inquiry, think of quality nutrition more as a right of initiation that will repair your physical body, raise your vibration, elevate your consciousness and take you on a wild and unexpected journey towards healing, a sense of purpose, greater authenticity and actualization that will be unpredictable and challenging but ultimately astounding.

This is a process Julie and I call going beyond the kale. And it&#039;s the primary theme of this week&#039;s offering.

EnterTim Van Orden.

If you have been with me on this podcast journey since it&#039;s inception, then you will recall my conversation with Tim back in the early days –RRP Episode 15to be exact. Over the course of that conversation we delved into Tim&#039;s personal story, particularly his trajectory from relatively aimless and unhealthy junk food vegetarian to the raw food fueled running champion he is today. An exploration of food, athleticism, consciousness and holistic minimalism that transformed this non-athlete into a 10-time US Masters Trail Running National Champion.

You may also recall the horrible Skype audio. At that time I was still trying to find my voice and had yet to master the technology (I still haven&#039;t, which is one of many reasons why I resist interviewing guests by Skype). Moreover, I had yet to actually meet Tim in person. Fast forward 92 episodes and now we’re friends -- conversing in person and picking up where Episode 15 left off.

This week it&#039;s less about diet and more about the bigger picture. Specifically, this conversation focuses on the psychology and emotional landscape that informs and drives self-perception, habits (both healthy and unhealthy) and decision making. This is a very frank, honest, open and soul bearing exchange about ego, vulnerability, authenticity, and attachment. It&#039;s about self-image as a predictor of mood, action and outcome. It&#039;s about the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves that inform how we see ourselves in the world. It&#039;s about the self-acceptance required to confront and ultimately overcome the dreaded and unhealthy aspects of ourselves we keep hidden that handicap growth. And it&#039;s about the process we must undertake to reframe our story, start telling a new one and ultimately set us on a healthier path towards greater freedom and fulfillment.

I really dig Tim, his vibe, honesty and willingness to be raw (pardon the pun). He is truly a special guy and I am so pleased to bring his insights to you today.</itunes:summary>

P.S. At the beginning of the show, I fumbled my thoughts when trying to describe my take on the nutritional benefits of the miracle superfood called Moringa (Olefiera), so I thought I would expound upon it here. Dubbed the “miracle tree” and the “world’s most nutritious plant species ever studied,” this amazing tree is native to regions of Africa/Asia but can grow almost anywhere due to its incredible ability to extract nutrients from the soil and air. Its leaves are an all-around green superfood; with more than 90 nutrients, moringa is like a utility baseball player that can excel in every position. High in a wide array of vitamins and minerals it’s anti-oxidant rich (46 anti-oxidants), anti-diabetes (reduces blood glucose) and promotes heart health (lipid lowering) among other benefits. Available in capsule and powder form, brew the powder into a tea or add to juice or your morning smoothie (like the smoothie Tim and I shared over our conversation).

		<itunes:summary>The subject of &quot;Millennials&quot; generally conjures up adjectives like lazy or entitled. No work ethic. Spoiled brats, the lot of them. TIME Magazine went so far as to call millennials the &quot;Me Me Me Generation&quot;.
This has not been my experience with the teens and twenty-somethings among us. In fact, I can honestly say that I find myself relating to many millennials better than I relate to my own generation. Maybe that just makes me juvenile. But that&#039;s a perspective lazier that the millennial stereotype itself.
Admittedly, my exposure to this cross-section of our society is somewhat self-selecting. But it&#039;s worth noting that over the last several years I&#039;ve had the good fortune of meeting dozens of incredibly dynamic, conscious and entrepreneurial young people. Kids highly engaged in things my generation didn’t give a crap about like permaculture, social issues, sustainability, conservation and mindfulness. Students with doctorates and business degrees who could be on Wall Street instead toiling away on organic farms, working for non-profits, or starting their own -- choosing career paths based not on security and salary but on impact. People leveraging the power of social media to challenge societal norms, disrupt outdated modalities, create self-styled careers that didn&#039;t previously exist and launch their own grassroots movements.
The common thread is the singular goal -- to make the world a better place for all of us.
Jackson Foster is one of these guys -- the best kind of millennial. A guy whose life presented him with every open door possible, it would have been easy for Jackson to simply step into a safe and secure (an illusion I know, but you get my point) high paying business career.
But Jackson has other plans.
In high school, while most of Jackson’s teen peers were playing video games, partying and generally just acting like, well teenagers, Jackson spent a year in the Colorado wilderness. After being accepted into the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design, he decided instead to defer so he could travel – a year spent bicycling across the US, hiking the John Muir Trail, mountaineering in Laos and even working at an orangutan orphanage in Borneo.
These experiences left him thinking about one thing: food.
Jackson noticed how food greatly affected the livelihood of different communities around the world, which motivated a desire to immerse himself in diet and lifestyle study. This exploration left him with no choice but to walk his talk; a wholesale transition from a beer drinking, weed smoking, junk food vegetarian teenager reborn as a whole food plant-based activist and educator.
Jackson transferred from RISD to Colorado College as an Environmental Policy major and went to work. Outside his college coursework he found the time to: become a Certified Yoga Instructor; obtain a Certification In Plant-based Nutrition through the T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies; start the website Plantriotic; found and chair a vegan student group at Colorado College; write for Vegan Health and Fitness Magazine; spend his summers working with environmental groups like 350.org; help with student recruitment for the recent People’s Climate March in New York City; and last but hardly least, begin work on his first book.
How&#039;s that for a lazy, entitled millennial?
I first met this week&#039;s enterprising young guest last Spring when he invited me to speak at Colorado College. It was a fantastic experience, which included quality time spent with him, his fellow students as well as his documentary filmmaker brother and lovely and incredibly supportive parents, all three of whom flew out from Los Angeles just to support Jackson in hosting my presentation.
In stark contrast to my self-obsessed, party-dominated college experience, I was struck by Jackson&#039;s passion as well as inspired by his personal story. An evolution from typical high school student to independent thinker with an unequivocal dedication to fostering a healthie</itunes:summary>

Even if you happen to disagree with aspects of his point of view (Jackson is nothing if not a bit radical, admittedly so) you will be hard pressed not to be impressed by his conviction; his selfless devotion to service; and the courageous choices this young man has made for the simple sake of making the world just a little bit better.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

		<itunes:summary>Some people are artists. Others are athletes. It&#039;s the rare individual who can excel at both.
As I kid, I was interested in sport and things creative. But for some reason, I came to the conclusion that you just can&#039;t do it all. I had to pick and never the &#039;twain shall meet. Call it a left brain, right brain thing.
Most of us lean in one direction. We&#039;re either logical and calculated by nature, or we&#039;re whimsical dreamers. We settle on a side and call it a day. But what if we really could excel at both?
My Australian mate Daniel MacPherson is great example of someone who seamlessly traverses back and forth between seemingly unrelated worlds, tightrope walking both hemispheres of the mysterious cranium with facile grace and ease. Not only is he a tremendously talented and gifted athlete – a guy who has competed at the highest levels in triathlon, he is also a quite gifted artist – as an actor, television host and media personality. Not to mention an exceptionally successful and celebrated one at that.
It&#039;s by no means a stretch to call Dan the Ryan Secrest of Australia -- and I mean that in the most complimentary, non-perjorative sense. Brimming with good looks, endless charm, intelligence, athletic prowess and creativity to boot, quite simply put it&#039;s hard to imagine there is anything Dan can&#039;t do, and do well.
Dan has qualified for and raced the Ironman World Championships, the Half Ironman 70.3 World Championships, and began his triathlon career at the storied Cronulla Triathlon Club in the suburbs of Sydney, training amidst the sport&#039;s greatest athletes – world champions like Craig Alexander &amp; Chris McCormack (my guest on RRP episode 24). This is the same club that produced triathlon legends Greg Welch and Michellie Jones – the biggest names in the more formative years of triathlon.
As a youth, Dan was intent on becoming the best triathlete he could be. Then something totally out of the blue happened. At the conclusion of a local race, he was “discovered.&quot;
The rest is history.
Best known for his role on Australia’s long running series Neighbours, Dan starred in City Homicide, the British police drama The Bill and was the host of Australia’s X-Factor. He is the currently co-host of Australia&#039;s wildly popular Dancing with the Stars and is starring in a soon to be released independent sci-fi drama called Infini (trailer below).
But despite Dan&#039;s blinding good looks and impeccable fitness, what is amazing is that it wasn&#039;t always this way. You might be surprised to learn that Dan was actually a chubby and somewhat insecure young bloke. A kid who, at a young age, embraced fitness and healthy lifestyle to transcend his situation and transform himself wholesale.

Passionate about service and giving back, Dan now leverages his fame and popularity for the benefit of the Indigenous Marathon Project, a non-profit dedicated to uplifting Australia&#039;s Indigenous populations via the transformative power of marathon running. An organization devoted to creating Indigenous role models, inspiring Indigenous people and promoting healthy and active lifestyles throughout Indigenous communities across Australia.
He may not be a full blown professional triathlete, but Dan is beyond pro behind the microphone. Because he is so highly engaging, Dan makes my job easy and this is a really fun conversation. A conversation that traverses triathlon, television, movies, the LA entertainment business, creativity, the quest for athletic prowess and how he successfully balances all of the important aspects of his life to stay on top.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

		<fullsummary>Some people are artists. Others are athletes. It's the rare individual who can excel at both.
As I kid, I was interested in sport and things creative. But for some reason, I came to the conclusion that you just can't do it all. I had to pick and never the 'twain shall meet. Call it a left brain, right brain thing.
Most of us lean in one direction. We're either logical and calculated by nature, or we're whimsical dreamers. We settle on a side and call it a day. But what if we really could excel at both?
My Australian mate Daniel MacPherson is great example of someone who seamlessly traverses back and forth between seemingly unrelated worlds, tightrope walking both hemispheres of the mysterious cranium with facile grace and ease. Not only is he a tremendously talented and gifted athlete – a guy who has competed at the highest levels in triathlon, he is also a quite gifted artist – as an actor, television host and media personality. Not to mention an exceptionally successful and celebrated one at that.
It's by no means a stretch to call Dan the Ryan Secrest of Australia -- and I mean that in the most complimentary, non-perjorative sense. Brimming with good looks, endless charm, intelligence, athletic prowess and creativity to boot, quite simply put it's hard to imagine there is anything Dan can't do, and do well.
Dan has qualified for and raced the Ironman World Championships, the Half Ironman 70.3 World Championships, and began his triathlon career at the storied Cronulla Triathlon Club in the suburbs of Sydney, training amidst the sport's greatest athletes – world champions like Craig Alexander &amp; Chris McCormack (my guest on RRP episode 24). This is the same club that produced triathlon legends Greg Welch and Michellie Jones – the biggest names in the more formative years of triathlon.
As a youth, Dan was intent on becoming the best triathlete he could be. Then something totally out of the blue happened. At the conclusion of a local race, he was “discovered."
The rest is history.
Best known for his role on Australia’s long running series Neighbours, Dan starred in City Homicide, the British police drama The Bill and was the host of Australia’s X-Factor. He is the currently co-host of Australia's wildly popular Dancing with the Stars and is starring in a soon to be released independent sci-fi drama called Infini (trailer below).
But despite Dan's blinding good looks and impeccable fitness, what is amazing is that it wasn't always this way. You might be surprised to learn that Dan was actually a chubby and somewhat insecure young bloke. A kid who, at a young age, embraced fitness and healthy lifestyle to transcend his situation and transform himself wholesale.

Passionate about service and giving back, Dan now leverages his fame and popularity for the benefit of the Indigenous Marathon Project, a non-profit dedicated to uplifting Australia's Indigenous populations via the transformative power of marathon running. An organization devoted to creating Indigenous role models, inspiring Indigenous people and promoting healthy and active lifestyles throughout Indigenous communities across Australia.
He may not be a full blown professional triathlete, but Dan is beyond pro behind the microphone. Because he is so highly engaging, Dan makes my job easy and this is a really fun conversation. A conversation that traverses triathlon, television, movies, the LA entertainment business, creativity, the quest for athletic prowess and how he successfully balances all of the important aspects of his life to stay on top.

		<itunes:summary>Safe to say I am mildly obsessed with Ganesh, the famous Hindu elephant boy god.
Even if you don&#039;t know anything about this odd creature or what he represents, you likely know who I&#039;m talking about. The iconic youngster’s unmistakeable visage is ubiquitous these days -- adorning yoga studios, hanging around people’s homes, emblazoned on t-shirts and even splayed across brick wall street art in hipster neighborhoods across America.
But how does this have anything to do with this week’s guest?
Patience. I’ll bring it around. I always do.
The thumbnail fable of Ganesh goes something like this: young boy warrior fiercely devoted to his beloved mother Parvati meets his match in Parvati&#039;s abusive husband Shiva. Defending Parvati from Shiva&#039;s angry rage late one night while Parvati bathed, Shiva up and just decapitates the young boy. Cut his head straight off!
Inconsolable and furious, Parvati is determined to bring her boy back to life. Towards this end, she strikes a deal with Shiva that (inexplicably) involves replacing Ganesh&#039;s missing head with that of a young elephant (again, don&#039;t ask me how this works, it just does). Rejoice! It works. Not only does Ganesh return to life, he ascends the covetous deity pecking order, becoming one of the most worshipped of ancient Hindu devas.
Ganesh the remover of obstacles. Ganesh the patron of arts. Ganesh the deity of intellect and wisdom. Ganesh the Lord of success.
The elephant head represents the displacement of individual ego with Universal ego – the idea that before we leave this life we must no longer identify with the limited individual self, but rather with the large universal Self. In this way, our spiritual life is renewed, maturing into one that can truly benefit Creation. 
Associated with mental agility, Ganesh’s single broken tusk represents the “pen” he creates to transcribe epic poetry -- the vast learnings he has experienced. What I&#039;m saying is that Ganesh was a writer.
Ganesh was also a god of astounding appetites. And – most importantly for today&#039;s discourse -- a god that befriended a tiny mouse, often depicted under his foot as his ever present companion. The mouse is commonly interpreted as a symbol for those seeking to overcome powerful low vibrating desires and become less selfish -- the quest to find greater meaning and purpose in life.
Here’s where things get weird. The life arc of todays guest Mishka Shubaly (in his fifth appearance on the podcast – more co-host than guest at this point) bears more than passing similarity to our little Hindu friend.
Sorry Mishka, but I would go so far as to call you guys doppelgängers. Metaphorically at least.
Like Ganesh, Mishka is a man devoted to the arts and greater self-wisdom. A man devoted to his mother and scarred by a troubled relationship with his father. A man who has made his mark on the world by transcribing his broken past and attraction to destructive appetites as a primer for greater self-knowledge with a fearlessness that evokes Ganesh’s broken tusk. A man now ascending to become foremost among literary talents.
Mishka&#039;s words serve up someone toiling with identity, his place in the world, and the conflict that breathes between ego and Universal Self. A man grappling with his own obstacles on a path towards maturing into one who can truly benefit Creation. An appealing yet reluctant determination for greater self-wisdom I think we can all -- on some level -- relate to our own personal challenges and life experiences.
And yet quite ironically, Mishka is also man who just just weeks ago knew little to nothing about this Ganesh character. This despite the huge elephant tattoo covering the better part of his left arm. The elephant t-shirts that bear his name. And his pet mouse.
You heard me right.
Mishkalito the tiny mouse that just as Ganesh, Mishka befriended that became his constant companion. A mouse that broke his heart wide open. A symbol for his gut wrenching wrangling laid bare.</itunes:summary>

Mishkalito the tiny mouse that just as Ganesh, Mishka befriended that became his constant companion. A mouse that broke his heart wide open. A symbol for his gut wrenching wrangling laid bare. And a mouse that became the central subject in this writer’s latest confessional -- the #1 bestselling Kindle Single Of Mice and Me. A novella that pits Mishka’s low vibrating desires against his persistent, yet almost diffident yearning for greater meaning, connection and purpose.
Mishka, the modern day Ganesh. I like the ring of that.
Told you I’d bring it around. I always do.
If you are a long-time listener of the podcast, then you’ve treated yourself to several of our conversations. You know this guy at this point. He doesn’t need much formal introduction.
If you care about things like resumés, his goes something like this:
After receiving an expensive MFA from Columbia University, Mishka promptly quit writing to play music. He lived out of a Toyota minivan for a year, touring nonstop, and has shared the stage with artists like The Strokes, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs and The Decemberists.
His Kindle Singles – short non fiction novellas -- have all been bestsellers. He writes true stories about drinking, drugs, disasters, desire, deception and their aftermath. His work has been praised for its grit, humor, fearlessness and heart. The Long Run, his mini-memoir detailing his transformation from alcoholic drug abuser to sober ultrarunner is one of the best-selling Kindle Singles in Amazon history.

I urge all of you to check out his canon (links below). And no, you do not need a Kindle! You can read these offerings on basically any computer device; there are even free Kindle apps for both iOS and Android.

If you dig the Mishka vibe and want to hear more, check out RRP episodes 27, 31, 65 &amp; 95. That's about 7 hours of Mishka for your earbuds.
Otherwise, I hope you enjoy this peek into the complicated, curious, fascinating and always entertaining mind of Mishka Shubaly. Pretty sure this is our best conversation to date. Let me know what you think in the comments below.
Peace + Plants,

P.S. - Literally moments (and by that I mean 2-3 minutes maximum) after I published this episode, the New York Times published a piece in the business section on the feud between Amazon and Hachette, featuring Mishka. Who would have thought Mishka's picture would ever be on the front page the NY Times business section? That is the miracle of sobriety at work right there. Read the article HERE.

Wise words that capture the essence of this week&#039;s guest, Preston Smiles.

When you meet Preston, you immediately understand who this guy is. He wears it on his sleeve. It&#039;s written all over his face. He just is exactly who he is.
It&#039;s much harder to describe Preston in words. But I&#039;ll give it a shot. A leader in the emergent world of conscious media, Preston is a pretty unique cat -- one of the most present, focused, passionate, open and giving people I have ever met. But honestly, everything that Preston is can be boiled down to one word – maybe the most important word in our lexicon – love.
A wellspring of creativity, Preston is a writer (Huff Po / The Daily Love), a motivational messenger, a thought leader and co-founder of something called The Love Mob – a global, grassroots flash mob movement that ignites community building through “Organized Acts of Love.&quot;

The Preston I know is an unlikely evolution from a very different guy. Raised under challenging circumstances, young Preston was a hyperactive, dyslexic gang member prone to beatings and beating others. An angry, disenfranchised young man looking at an almost certain future of violence, drug abuse, jails and institutions.
But Preston was able to escape this path. An emotional and spiritual transformation that instead produced a man full of life, devoted to serving others and downright unafraid to embrace and exude love, consciousness and unity -- hardly the most popular subjects among men in our society.

Preston is both a friend and an inspiration, and I am proud to share his powerful story and message with you today.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation. Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.
Peace + Plants,

P.S.: Thoughts are things. This week&#039;s assignment is to pay closer attention to those thoughts. Identify the negative patterns that constantly loop. Make a choice to take one of those thoughts and invert it. It doesn’t matter if you don’t actually believe the new message you tell yourself about yourself – just act as if. Do that, repeat it until it becomes the new default thought replacing the old negative one. Then tackle another one. Rinse and repeat. Let me know how it goes in the comments below.

		<itunes:summary>In case you missed it, and because it&#039;s highly relevant to today&#039;s show, let&#039;s begin this week&#039;s offering with a read (or re-read?) of a piece I posted a while back on Medium.com entitled, Why You Should Stop Hacking Your Life &amp; Invest in The Journey.
Before you pounce on me for going all Grandpa Roll on you, let me point out that I’m all for efficiencies. But I’m more about the 10,000 hours of hard work that goes into creating something amazing. The hustle, passion, focus, and grit required to birth a dream. The work ethic and commitment to not just be good, but great – not just for you – driven by ego or self-aggrandizement – but for the betterment of everyone.
Whether you get there or not, it’s the commitment I admire. It&#039;s the action that matters. So stop resisting it by obsessing on shortcuts and instead just embrace the work. Because the inherent value in any undertaking is the road travelled to get there anyway. Do this, and you will be amazed by the places your life will take you.
Today’s guest embodies this ethos perfectly.
I love Amanda Slavin because she gets it. Someone who had a crazy vision, set aside her fear, took a leap of faith, followed her gut and worked her butt off -- all because she believed in something big -- the possibility to improve lives and make a positive difference in the world.
Looking back on her life, it all makes perfect sense. She was born to do what she does. It wasn&#039;t always that way however. But things began to change for Amanda when she made a firm decision to just start surrounding herself with positive, inspiring people committed to advancing change. Over time, Amanda began to exude the wavelength of these new associations, providing her with the courage and self belief to then channel that positivity into her dream -- the creation of a new community of paradigm-busting thought leaders leveraging technology and relationships to forge positive social, economic, educational and civic change in urban centers across the nation.
Disillusioned with traditional modalities of education in the wake of receiving her masters degree in curriculum, Amanda began her professional career as an event planner for various restaurants in New York City. Blessed with natural people skills and an innate talent for getting crowds of cool people to show up where she wanted them to show up, Amanda started to think about how she could channel this facility for good. Her first big dream was realized when she helped birth the first Global Citizen Festival -- a now annual concert series in New York City&#039;s Central Park that draws 60,000 attendees and this September will feature Jay-Z, No Doubt, Carrie Underwood, fun., The Roots and Tiësto.
This experience ultimately led Amanda to some very interesting posts as both a brand and event consultant with incredible organizations like Life Is Beautiful (Las Vegas&#039; version of the Global Citizen Festival) and Summit Series -- a series of events and a growing community of inspiring thought leaders that catalyze entrepreneurship, achievement and positive global change (as someone who has spent time with the Summit community, I can attest to the power of this unique and incredible organization).
But her biggest accomplishments were yet to come.
I first met Amanda about a year ago when she invited me out to something called Catalyst Week, a monthly event she personally curates and hosts through her company Catalyst Creativ that brings inspiring thought leaders to Downtown Las Vegas to share and contribute to the Downtown Project – a movement launched by Zappos CEO Tony Hseih to revitalize the downtown sector of Las Vegas into a vibrant community of entrepreneurship, artistry and commerce. The bigger vision? The creation of a scaleable model than can be replicated to revitalize underserved urban centers across the country.
Participating in Catalyst Week was an extraordinary and moving experience for me personally. And I was so impressed by Amanda&#039;s passion, advocacy,</itunes:summary>

We live in this Kardashian-obsessed culture where mainstream media inclines towards the lowest denominator in women at the expense of the countless incredible female role models doing amazing things to make the world a better place. As a father of two young girls, it's not just my pleasure and honor to celebrate Amanda, it's my responsibility.
Amanda's message is both powerful and inspirational. I'm proud to bring it to you today.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.
Peace + Plants,

P.S.: A big part of this week's conversation is the lost importance of mentorship and apprenticeship. So this week's assignment is to find a mentor. Someone you respect and admire. Someone who exudes the qualities you would like to possess. Someone who has what you want. Set aside your fears and apprehensions, approach that person and simply ask for guidance. Stop waiting for that person to call you or ask you. Do the footwork. Make it happen. Then watch your life begin to change.
P.P.S: If you dig the music on the show, it's all courtesy of my talented son and producer Tyler -- he wrote, produced, arranged, and performed every track you hear in the last several dozen episodes. Do me a solid and give him a high five in the comments sections below - he deserves it!

		<itunes:summary>It’s been a crazy week. This past Monday, we launched our new iOS mobile app to immediate and rave reviews, posted our 100th episode and surpassed 3 million podcast downloads.
Pretty awesome, thanks entirely to you guys -- the audience. Most appreciated. But how did all these momentous milestones mysteriously transpire on the exact same day?
I call this the principle of Universal Synchronicity.
In my book, I wrote something like, “when purpose aligns with faith, the Universe will conspire to support you&quot; (actually I don&#039;t remember exactly what I said and right now I&#039;m too lazy to look it up, but I digress). Toss service into the equation and that’s when stuff gets really crazy. My version of the age-old precept (and again I am paraphrasing), give of yourself freely and you will receive tenfold in return.
I don’t know why – it doesn’t make sense in the context of our logical three-dimensional world based in fact and physical laws like gravity. But that doesn&#039;t change the fact that these karmic principles seem to indeed be law. Spiritual tenets I suppose. Truths you can&#039;t touch, feel, see or hear. And yet without a doubt they are undeniable certitudes.
The aforementioned events in my life are a small thing in the context of life. They really don&#039;t mean that much. And easy to chalk up as mere &quot;coincidence.&quot; But through direct experience I know better. Cosmic signals. Roadsigns along the journey. I am being supported. And for that I am incredibly grateful.
When you begin to pay attention -- I mean center your attention, turn off the chattering mind, get present and really tune in to your environment -- you begin to realize that even the tiniest observations, events and exchanges can carry meaning. Not always. And not necessarily in any external sense, but with the implication that everything is evidence -- forensic tools to help calibrate the compass of your life&#039;s trajectory.
To put things in perspective, I don’t have enough fingers and toes to count the number of times I have found myself in a metaphorical canoe without a paddle – unsure where I was being directed and just surrendering to the current, present and open to what might come downriver and proceeding only on intuition, instinct and faith.
Every time I allow myself to get out of the way, simply let go and allow, I end up someplace unexpected. This is not to be mistaken for giving up. In my experience it takes great courage to surrender the reins of control. And at the time it might not seem like it leads to such a great a place. I might (often?) temporally judge it as disastrous. But with the passage of time and the onset of objectivity, it&#039;s almost unilaterally something great. Typically a better situation I could never have anticipated. And inevitably a superior outcome than I would have handpicked for myself if given the opportunity to dictate the result.
By contrast, when I am clinging to ego, fueled by character defects, self will, self-interest or base impulse (which is more often that I care to admit, although I guess I am admitting it now), my instincts are unreliable. My intuition is adrift. The result? The Universe will inevitably deliver me the lesson I need, which generally involves enduring a proper right-sizing. Time for another compass recalibration.
In either case, it&#039;s always and without fail exactly where I am meant to be. I know this to be true because every time I peer into my rear view, it always adds up. Good or bad, the math is inevitably perfect. I wish I could access this perspective looking forward, but for whatever reason life just doesn&#039;t work that way. That kind of sucks. But it&#039;s also kind of great.
If I lost you, I get it. I still struggle mightily with these ideas. Too new age for me broseph - I&#039;m out!
If you are still with me, I get that too. So how can I begin the process of getting right with myself?
I always say the best (and easiest) place to begin is with the food on your plate; what you put in your mouth.</itunes:summary>

I always say the best (and easiest) place to begin is with the food on your plate; what you put in your mouth. Change that vibration for the better and you just might be amazed by the extent to which your precious compass will begin to mysteriously recalibrate itself. A powerful baseline to begin anew; reconsider your life. And embrace the new journey that follows.
That’s my story. And it’s also the story of today’s guest – a guy who had a passion for healthy, clean, performance enhancing nutrition that catalyzed quite an amazing, unexpected journey to becoming recognized as one of the most prominent modern voices, athletes and entrepreneurs and authors in the world of health, fitness and nutrition.
Recognized as one of the world’s foremost authorities on plant-based nutrition and sports performance, it’s fair to say that Brendan is the guy leading the charge in the plant-based athletic performance kingdom. To be sure, he was the first guy I looked to personally (and continue to do so) for guidance, information, support and inspiration when I began exploring the nexus between performance and athleticism on a diet fueled entirely on plants. And suffice to say I'm not alone in this regard. It's no understatement to say that Brendan deserves ample credit for truly galvanizing this global plantpowered evolution/revolution -- his books, products and message largely responsible for unleashing thousands of of eager plant-based athletes into the wild...
Former professional ironman triathlete. 2-time Canadian 50K Ultrarunning champion. Formulator and face behind the wildly successful, ubiquitous and award-winning Vega line of plant-based nutritional products. Partner in the Zön Fitness Program and founder of Thrive Foods Direct – a nationwide plant-based foods delivery service. Corporate and university guest lecturer and in demand public speaker on all things plant-based, Brendan has even spoken before the U.S. Congress. Bestselling author of the Thrive book series. Not enough? Brendan was also named one of the Top 40 Under 40 list of most influential people in the health industry by Natural Food Merchandise and serves as a successful performance consultant to world class, Olympic and professional athletes of all type and shape, including professional MMA fighters, cyclists, cycling teams like Garmin Sharp, and players in the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL.
His latest venture? Thrive Magazine, a publication whose mission statement reads: to give all who aspire to continually improve the inspiration, tools, resources, and community to do so. Sound familiar? Indeed. I like to think of Thrive as a glossy print version of what I do my best to offer through this podcast -- in depth interviews with the most innovative, inspiring people and personalities working to change the face of health, athletics, nutrition, creativity and entrepreneurship. 
But beyond the labels, the books, the accomplishments, the accolades and the entrepreneurial success, at his core Brendan is simply a guy devoted to service – his compass properly calibrated to educate and inspire all people to access and embrace a more ethical, environmentally friendly, and healthy lifestyle. In certain respects, as he so candidly discloses during the course of our conversation, he is a most unlikely successful entrepreneur.
To bring it full circle, Brendan is a man who embodies this principle of Universal Synchronicity: a man driven by purpose; fueled by faith in said purpose; and devoted to service. And so it comes as no surprise that the Universe has conspired to support him. And in Brendan's success we all benefit.
Brendan isn’t just an inspiration, he’s a friend I am proud to champion. I’m really pleased and honored to share his story with you today. Even if you think you know the guy, I assure you this conversation is different. I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering.
Peace + Plants,

	<itunes:subtitle>100 EPISODES! Wow. I can&#039;t believe how amazing this podcast journey has been. Over the last week, I have been flooded with inquiries on social media – so who is going to be the special guest for the big episode 100? A lot of speculation.</itunes:subtitle>

Wow. I can&#039;t believe how amazing this podcast journey has been.
Over the last week, I have been flooded with inquiries on social media – so who is going to be the special guest for the big episode 100?
A lot of speculation. Big names getting thrown around with anticipatory question marks. I understand the appeal. But this landmark has me sentimental. Thinking a lot about what was going on in my life when I made the decision to start this show. And when perceived through this lens, there is only one person appropriate to sit across from me for 100 -- the same person who sat across from me for #1.
Julie Piatt.
The wheel turns. We come full circle. Revisit. Reflect. Give thanks. And move forward.
So much has changed since November 2012 when the show launched. To take a quantum leap forward, we must connect with and better understand the past. So I went back and listened to that very first offering -- for the first time since I recorded it. Admittedly rough. Unpolished. Nervous energy, echo chamber audio and uncertainty converging in a vacant warehouse on an organic farm on the north shore of Kauai. Just me, Julie, a couple really bad mics and no expectations or idea as to where this leap would land.
And yet I was dumbstruck by just how much the show has stayed true to the seed I planted that day.
I vividly recall that day. My son Tyler and my nephew Harrison jerry-rigging their musical equipment to manage the audio. I remember the theme music they wrote and recorded in the warehouse just hours before the first show -- a riff they came up without much thought and always intended as &quot;temp&quot; until they wrote something better. Julie and I sitting across from each other, wondering just what we might talk about.
Two years later and I&#039;m astonished at just how little has changed. Today Ty (who is now my producer and the guy behind all the show music) and Harrison strummed guitars and checked audio levels as I set up in our garage. That temp theme music still begins each episode. And Julie and I still stare across at each other before every show we do together, wondering just what the conversation might bring.
But what really struck me about that first episode is that my improvised introduction and meandering thoughts, words, intentions and aspirations for what the show might become mirror exactly what the show has indeed become 100 episodes and hundreds of recorded hours later -- compelling long-form conversations with inspiring, paradigm busting minds and personalities in health, wellness, nutrition, fitness, entrepreneurship, creativity and spirituality with one singular goal – to help you discover, uncover, unlock and unleash your best, most authentic self.
Although I know I have gotten better at this, I still consider myself rather amateur behind the mic. But I’m proud of the show we’ve built. A show that has promoted dialog around new ideas. A toolbox of inspiration and education for transcending your circumstances. A platform for unlocking your inner potential – in whatever form that may be – by introducing and discussing new (sometimes controversial or fringe) ideas with the hope that you will take what resonates with you and not only use it, but share it.
The Power of Community
I send the show out into the ether every week. But it&#039;s you, the audience, who has taken what alone is nothing more than an inert digital file comprised of ones and zeroes -- and fertilized it. A seed you have fostered into something much bigger and more important than a simple weekly .mp3. Something remarkable:
Community.
When I think back on the history of the show to date, it&#039;s crystal clear what is truly important. And most beautiful. A global water cooler around which we can connect over a myriad of ideas with one collective goal -- be and do better. Together.
Community.

Community. 
That's what today's show is all about.
No matter what your goal or aspiration – irrespective of how solitary you believe its pursuit – you simply cannot truly score on your own. Everyone needs a team. Everyone needs a support network. Everyone needs help. Everyone needs a Board of Advisors.
Birth family or soul family. Children or parents. Friends or co-workers. Clubs or crews. The shape and form of these networks of support mean less than the quality of the individuals that comprise them.
The point is this: when your team is intact, in alignment, supportive and strong, miracles can occur.
Together we are one. Together we are strong. Together we can change the world.
Let's Talk About Gratitude
With the reflection that comes with milestones I am overwhelmed with gratitude. Let this 100th episode serve as a big thank you to all of you out there who have helped me along the path. Without a doubt, this includes you – the listener. Thank you for your courage; for taking the leap; and walking this journey alongside me. Thank you for putting wind in my sails by tuning in week after week.
And thank you for giving me hope in the good -- the promise of a better more fulfilling, legacy worthy purpose here on Earth in this short life.
But most of all, thank you for letting me serve. Because it is in service that I find purpose, meaning and a sense of deep satisfaction that positively infuses every aspect of my daily life experience.
I Want To Hear From You (Plus Giveaway!)
In addition, I want to thank each and every one of you -- and there are many -- who have taken the time to reach out and share with me your challenges, victories and struggles. I cannot overstate the extent to which your experiences humble me; hold me accountable for my own actions; inspire me to do and be better; and ennoble me to soldier on in the face of whatever obstacles I may face.
Which brings me to an idea..
If you have been positively influenced by this show to make a personally significant change in your life, I want to hear your story. If you're up for sharing, please weave your tale in the comments section below. If you'd rather remain anonymous (I get it), then e-mail your testimony to findingultra@gmail.com (I am the only person who will see these e-mails and your confidence will not be shared). To the extent of your willingness to be vulnerable, let it all hang out: the struggles you faced, how you overcame and how this show might have played a (small part).
I’m not looking to take any credit whatsoever for anybody’s journey. Any improvements you made to your life, well that’s on you entirely. Hats off and head bowed in reverence. I just love the stories. It helps me feel more connected to you. It helps dry the cement on this community bond I am trying to foster – a bond over just being better.
I promise to read everything. Then I’ll pick 3 and send the chosen a sweet care package of thanks and congratulations. Because giving back is what it means to be part of a community.
This week is about honoring just that. It's what this show is -- and has always been -- all about.
I sincerely hope you enjoy this 100th conversation. And again, thank you. Really.
Peace + Plants,

PS - Next week I finally sit down with the great Brendan Brazier. I know there is a lot of anticipation for this one, and it doesn't disappoint. So stay tuned!

		<itunes:summary>&quot;Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames.&quot;
Rumi


I like to think this show sparks that fire by seeking out and sharing the stories of those who fan my flames. A mixed bag of inspiration and education. A diversity of in-depth conversations: life experiences, incredible personal stories, tales of transformation and a wealth of information to light your personal path towards maximum life satisfaction. A grab-bag toolbox to help you escape the status quo doldrums of life, raise your personal vibration and simply live better.
At the end of the day, it&#039;s all about story. Others sharing theirs so you can begin to reframe, tell and live a better story of yourself.
It’s easy to keep doing what you’re doing, propelled by a story you tell yourself about yourself, in whatever shape or form that may take. Life has a momentum like that. A particular gestalt. The relentless pressures and priorities of daily life take over and before we even consciously realize it, we fall victim to a rut we justify under the rubric of routine.
The rut is easy. It&#039;s the default imprimatur of social acceptance. Do what you&#039;re told. Don&#039;t ask questions. Shut up and keep shopping. Play that video game. Escape. And numb out your latent voice; your inner potential; and the world at large.
To escape this prison we must first change the story. This begins with the inside work. Investigate what makes you the only you there is. Develop a sense of self that renders your intuition not just reliable, but the only true compass directing your path. Walk through the fear that constrains the emergence of the true self. Unleash the courage to blaze your own path. And execute. Because talk is cheap. And action is everything.
Doing this is hard. Maybe the hardest thing you will ever do, it&#039;s like a salmon swimming upstream. Or setting sail in stormy seas in a canoe without a paddle.
But let&#039;s flip our perspective and view this path through a new pair of glasses. Not from a perspective of struggle and hardship but instead as more of a letting go. Rather than fight, surrender. Rather than climb a mountain, let&#039;s fall into who you really are. A natural process as effortless as a snake shedding an old skin.
This is what faith is all about. It&#039;s about understanding that that shed skin will soon be replaced with a new one that fits more perfectly. It&#039;s about being comfortable that that perilous, oar-less canoe will somehow self-orient to flow in the current of your true life purpose. And the idea that when the sea settles, you will find yourself no longer in that rut, but effortlessly gliding in a special, secret current with your name on it. The eddy of your personal life purpose if you will.
I realize of course that this all sounds counter-intuitive, if not downright weird. Letting go to ascend? Surrendering for the win? Hippy-dippy new-age crap! I get it. I used to feel the same. It took me years to really understand that it is the firm grip -- attachment to ideas and behaviors -- that keeps us stuck. And that freedom comes when we let go and release that grip and our attachment to behaviors and patterns and beliefs we mistakenly presume comprise our identity. These are truths. Spiritual laws if you will. Incredibly powerful tools I have used to get and stay sober; change my life path; and become more fully myself. Keys I continue to rely on daily to constantly challenge myself to grow and expand my horizons.
This is all a long way of saying that we all have the power to just start telling a new story about ourselves.
This is what Robin Arzón is all about.

This is what Robin Arzón is all about.
A self-proclaimed Ambassador Of Sweat, Robin is so many things: the inspirational voice behind her blog SHUTUPANDRUN, a NYC-based urban, bridge-running force of nature, an accomplished ultramarathoner (she once ran 5 marathons in 5 days across Utah), running coach, cycling instructor, as well as brand ambassador and social media producer, consulting with some of the biggest brands in the world, like Nike, Adidas and Puma.
And now Robin can add magazine founder and publisher to her resume with the recent release of UNDO Magazine. Where sweat meets culture, the new rag can be found worldwide in places like Urban Outfitters.
Hailing from Cuban and Puerto Rican parents, I would call Robin a modern day seeker clad in sweat and the latest fashions of the day, fueled by the ethos that there is no finish line. On a mission to redefine, reform, and rethink possibility through movement, Robin is a proper role model of female empowerment who never sacrifices style for function, bringing the bling, swagger, fashion and fun back to sweat, running and fitness with an infectious energy, personal zeal and unique style that is completely her own -- quintessentially urban, completely NYC, totally hip, impossibly infectious, and totally inclusive.
And now Robin is facing a new challenge. Recently diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, she’s taking her fight and irrepressible swagger to a new level of focus to serve and inspire to others.
What I find personally fascinating is that just two years ago, Robin was living a completely different life -- toiling away in obscurity as a very well compensated corporate lawyer at one of the world’s biggest and most prestigious law firms. Replete in high heels and business suits, her life was a revolving door of high-stakes deals, 80-hour workweeks, power lunches and skyscrapers. Needless to say it would have been easy for Robin to spend the rest of her days hammering huge paychecks and living an opulent New York City lifestyle.
But this was not her path. It wasn’t her passion. I think it's safe to say that at the time, Robin wasn't quite sure about what exactly she wanted out of life. But she did know one thing – she loved to run. And she had faith in one motto: we become what we commit to.
A near-death experience being held hostage at gunpoint several years prior helped place the preciousness of life into proper perspective for Robin, ultimately infusing her with the courage to take a leap into the void. And two years ago she did just that. Much like last week’s guest Evan Rock – and to continue on a theme -- Robin simply up and walked out on her secure, prosperous and upwardly mobile career -- letting it all go to step into the unknown of a completely new life without a roadmap beyond her intuition, passion, hustle and swagger. To set foot into that canoe without a paddle and let the current take her, with only one item on her to do list: do epic shit.
I’m so happy to have Robin in my life as a friend. And as a father of two little girls, I am inspired by her shining example of positive female empowerment amidst the fetid morass of our Kardashian-influenced culture.
Full time dreamer. Part-time hustler. How did Robin – to coin her hashtag -- "undo ordinary" and change the story she tells about herself? It's time to find out.
I am super excited to share Robin with you today and sincerely hope she inspires you to tell your own story.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>Today we go off-grid.

As some of you know, this show was launched from a yurt on Hawaii. It was about a year and half ago. At the time, we were at a crossroads. Unsure about our family&#039;s future in Los Angeles, we were looking for something new and different. Then out of the blue, a unique opportunity arose and we seized it. An opportunity for myself, my wife and our kids to see and embrace a different approach to life. 
Next thing we knew, we found ourselves living at Common Ground -- a living, breathing organic farm on the north shore of Kauai. For three months we ate and lived off the land (well, mostly). Our kids learned farming and permaculture harvesting food in the gardens. We cohabited in communal yurts shared with a bevy of energetic young people passionate about the environment, sustainability, food and soil. All told, we embraced a completely new and different experience of daily existence, cementing the idea that we have choice when it comes to lifestyle. The notion that -- all of the plenty excuses aside -- we don’t have to live the way everyone else does.
A powerful concept we wanted our kids to see, understand and experience on a fundamental, tactile level.
It takes courage to step outside the norm. In our case, we obviously returned to Los Angeles. In all honesty, I just wasn’t ready for that level of disconnect on a permanent basis at this stage in my life. But that doesn&#039;t mean it wasn&#039;t invaluable, because it was -- an experience I will always treasure and never forget. It&#039;s an understatement to say that it broadened my horizons. As a family unit, we were permanently changed. A powerful and constant reminder that there is another way. Always another way.
During our time on Kauai, I got a call from my friend Evan Rock.
A successful young, enterprising commercial real estate executive, I first met Evan when he was dating the young woman who frequently babysits for our little girls. I didn’t know much about him at that time, other than that Evan was a young man with a plan. Dreams of making it big financially. Driving a Porsche and living large. But not too dissimilar from me, Evan happened to be undergoing his own personal transformation. Something Julie calls dismantling. Taking stock of his life, he began to critically evaluate how he was spending his time. He discovered meditation. Unlocking, he then started asking himself questions -- big questions. What am I doing and why? What makes me truly happy? How can I better serve myself, my fellow man and the planet?
This practice soon led Evan to yoga, then plant-based nutrition. An increase in vitality led him to fitness, even dipping his toe into triathlon. As he continued to search and expand, he ultimately adopted a full fledged high-carb fruitarian lifestyle.
I&#039;ll never forget running into him at Whole Foods in Tarzana about two years ago. Clad in suit &amp; tie on break from his commercial real estate firm across the street, I watched Evan devour an entire watermelon for lunch to the bemusement of fellow lunch-goers.
This is a long way of saying that Evan was undergoing some fundamental, core changes and looking for more. During that phone call I could hear the earnestness in his voice. Mental gears turning, Evan expressed a deep curiosity about the hows and whys of what we were doing in Kauai. I could tell a plan was starting to hatch in his mind.
Fast forward to about 5 months ago when I discovered that Evan hadn&#039;t just quit his job, he completely cashed out of his comfortable life of financial security. The new owner of a nice chunk of property on the Hilo side of the Big Island of Hawaii, he just up and moved there.
Just Evan, a tractor and pickup truck with a tarp to cover the flatbed where he slept. Completely off-grid, his new home could only be described as a completely overgrown, seemingly inhospitable parcel of untouched tropical jungle in the middle of a nowhere paradise. And yet a piece of land teeming with potential.</itunes:summary>

Fast forward to about 5 months ago when I discovered that Evan hadn't just quit his job, he completely cashed out of his comfortable life of financial security. The new owner of a nice chunk of property on the Hilo side of the Big Island of Hawaii, he just up and moved there.
Just Evan, a tractor and pickup truck with a tarp to cover the flatbed where he slept. Completely off-grid, his new home could only be described as a completely overgrown, seemingly inhospitable parcel of untouched tropical jungle in the middle of a nowhere paradise. And yet a piece of land teeming with potential. The potential for a completely new life for himself -- and eventually others.
By day Evan worked tirelessly to clear the land. By night he slept on the back of his truck, often soaked by the nightly rain showers. And with the help of friends he eventually met on island, Evan recently built a tiny one room shelter that can only be loosely described as a "house". Newly christened Fruition Hawaii, the land is now home to several like-minded young people living as a collective. A potent seed germinating Evan's vision of creating a conscious community and retreat center.
Even more fascinating is that Evan has been documenting the entire process in real time on YouTube where you can see the project unfold from it's inception.
Whether this is your vibe or not, you simply cannot deny the courage it takes to execute upon the life that dwells in your creative imagination. The spine required to turn off autopilot; seize the reins of your personal destiny; and put action into vision. I'm not talking about the life expected of you, nor the life you think you are supposed to lead. I'm talking about the life of your wildest dreams.
Evan Rock completely removed himself from one life and boldly entered a new one.  A life divorced from the familiar trappings and distractions of modern urban existence and instead premised on nourishment of body, mind and spirit; a philosophy of abundance; a deepening of awareness; and most of all -- love.
Ready to go off grid? Let's do this. I sincerely hope you dig the conversation.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>Everyone loves a good transformation story.

We like it even better when it’s super dramatic. Preferably framed to appear like it all went down like some kind of overnight miracle. Bonus points for million dollar paydays, instantaneous cures, extreme but effortless weight loss and age reversal.
But that’s just not how this stuff works, people.
Growth and change are hard. And never overnight. It’s a process. 2, 3, 5 even 10 steps backwards for every single step in the right direction. Rinse &amp; repeat, generally in obscurity. It requires dedication, faith, time, toil and pain -- because getting out of your comfort zone is just that: uncomfortable. It means taking an honest look in the mirror and objectively evaluating your unpleasantries, missteps and weaknesses. Shedding light on blind spots. And grappling with demons, hardwired patterns and deeply ingrained perspectives on ourselves and our place in the world.
But change is also simple. It begins with a basic a decision to do (or not do) something; anything. A decision generally followed by tiny -- sometimes almost imperceptible -- changes in behavior made consistently over extended periods of time.
In other words, the trite annoying adage is true. Baby steps do move mountains.
True, sustainable personal growth rarely comes about by changing everything overnight. Instead, it’s about exploring and ultimately developing some level of mastery over just a few small yet important shifts – or even just one aspect of how you spend your time each day. Adopt this approach – a slight shift in perspective and behavior – and you just might be amazed at how impactful this can be on your life experience. How you see, feel about and ultimately interact with yourself, others and the world at large.
Do this -- and like today&#039;s guest -- you just might find yourself 10% Happier.
Dan Harris.
This guy is impressive. Young and ambitious, Dan joined ABC News in 2000 and quickly rose through the ranks under the mentorship of broadcasting legends Peter Jennings and Diane Sawyer. Today he balances duties as co-anchor of ABC News&#039; Nightline and co-anchor of the weekend edition of Good Morning America on top of filing reports and filling in on air throughout the week on various ABC News programs.
Along the way, Dan has covered some huge stories. He reported on the mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, Aurora, Colorado and Tucson, Arizona, and anchored natural disasters from Haiti to Myanmar to Hurricane Katrina. He has also covered combat in Afghanistan, Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, including six visits to war-torn Iraq.
The job is a relentless pressure cooker. The stress mounted, compounded by multiple tours as an embedded journalist in conflict ridden areas of the Middle East. Depression ensued, followed by self-medicating with recreational use of cocaine and ecstasy. Ultimately, these factors conspired to take a serious toll on Dan&#039;s mental and physical health. And it&#039;s here that things get interesting.
In June 2004, it all caught up with Dan (as these things are wont to do), ultimately manifesting in a very public panic attack on national TV – on Good Morning America of all shows -- in front of 5 million people. 
He wasn’t sure what was wrong with him, only that he knew he had to make some changes. Around this time, in a bizarre stroke of synchronicity, Peter Jennings assigned Dan to start covering stories on faith, religion and spirituality. Ugh. A lifelong nonbeliever, let&#039;s just say Dan was less than thrilled. But what ensued was a bizarre, unexpected adventure into the subculture of mega church pastors, self-help gurus, and brain scientists that eventually led Dan to understand that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head.  A thinking mind which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business yet also led him to make the decisions that provoked his on-air freak-ou</itunes:summary>

This guy is impressive. Young and ambitious, Dan joined ABC News in 2000 and quickly rose through the ranks under the mentorship of broadcasting legends Peter Jennings and Diane Sawyer. Today he balances duties as co-anchor of ABC News' Nightline and co-anchor of the weekend edition of Good Morning America on top of filing reports and filling in on air throughout the week on various ABC News programs.

He reported on the mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, Aurora, Colorado and Tucson, Arizona, and anchored natural disasters from Haiti to Myanmar to Hurricane Katrina.

Depression ensued, followed by self-medicating with recreational use of cocaine and ecstasy. Ultimately, these factors conspired to take a serious toll on Dan's mental and physical health. And it's here that things get interesting.
In June 2004, it all caught up with Dan (as these things are wont to do), ultimately manifesting in a very public panic attack on national TV – on Good Morning America of all shows -- in front of 5 million people. 
He wasn’t sure what was wrong with him, only that he knew he had to make some changes. Around this time, in a bizarre stroke of synchronicity, Peter Jennings assigned Dan to start covering stories on faith, religion and spirituality. Ugh. A lifelong nonbeliever, let's just say Dan was less than thrilled.

A thinking mind which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business yet also led him to make the decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.
We all have that voice in our head. It’s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we’re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we’re stuck with this voice – that there’s nothing we can do to rein it in – but Dan stumbled upon an effective way to do just that.
A protocol he always assumed to be either impossible or useless:
Meditation. 
That's right people. We're back to meditation. Do you detect a theme here??
After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Dan took a leap of faith. A deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even prison guards and marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness.
Dan's a great guy and it was super fun to sit down with him in his NYC Nightline office the other week to hear all about this adventure. An adventure he chronicles in his highly entertaining and illuminating memoir called – you guessed it – 10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works--A True Story.
It's a fun book that delves into the inner workings of national network news as Dan recounts how he stopped using drugs (always a favorite topic of mine), discovered the benefits of meditation (again, a recurrent theme of this show), and resolved the apparent conflict between meditation-induced equanimity and the aggressive competitiveness required for success as a TV-news journalist (something I continue to struggle with).
For a quick primer on what's in store prior to tuning in to the conversation, check him out on The Colbert Report, then treat yourself to this highly entertaining 15 minute talk Dan gave at the recent MindBodyGreen Revitalize Summit:
Let’s step into the world of Dan Harris.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

		<itunes:summary>Finding balance in life. Developing trust in something bigger than yourself. Surrendering your self-will. Relying on faith to guide you. And the courage to risk it all for the sake of living your best, most authentic life.
Today marks the return of my erstwhile co–host, mother of my children and my wife of 11 years.
Julie Piatt.
Last week we celebrated our anniversary by renewing our vows. A small little ceremony with just the kids, it was a meaningful way to pay tribute to this journey we&#039;ve taken. Bringing the kids into the equation, all six of us took the opportunity to share our own &quot;vows&quot; by expressing gratitude for what each member of the family brings to our communal band.
It&#039;s important to create ceremony around seminal moments. To pause. And take the time to honor each other. It was profound.  An event that brought us all closer to each other. And more connected to the journey ahead.
After being married for many years its easy to fall into cruise control – my across the board default mode. Whether its fitness, diet, profession, relationships, or (in my case) sobriety, it doesn&#039;t take much to convince ourselves that everything is cool, then ease off the gas.
Personally, taking things for granted is my pastime. Avoiding this pitfall is a daily practice that demands a level of focused consciousness around all aspects of my life to help me understand that there is always improvement to be had. That growth requires constant work and pressure and focus.
But a crucial truism I learned very early on in recovery is that there is no stasis. In every given moment you are either growing or regressing. Moving towards a drink or away from a drink. Heading towards something better or lapsing backwards into bad habits, behaviors, addictions, assumptions, modalities, whatever.
Without attention, my life can quickly spiral out of balance. Prone to obsessiveness, it&#039;s my nature to lose myself. To become so immersed in what I am doing, whatever it is – training, writing, podcasting – that I lose sight of the bigger picture. Other aspects of my busy life that require my attention. And more often than not, these aspects are the most important aspects.
Balance -- the primary topic of today&#039;s conversation -- is the fickle lover I am always courting yet struggle mightily to master. It&#039;s like squeezing a water ballon. Just when you think you&#039;ve got it compressed, something pops out. Squeeze the bulge down and it pops up somewhere else. Always see-sawing from over focusing on one aspect of my life at the distress of another. Story of my life.
The more work I do on myself, the better and bigger my life gets. With this comes more opportunities to get out of balance. Which means even more work to keep all the plates spinning at the same speed.  The irony.
Of course we all struggle with balancing our busy lives. It’s not easy. So today is all about trying to better understand the mechanics behind maintaining proper life balance to avoid the common pitfalls. And keep us on track, moving in the right direction.
Julie -- a much more innately balanced person than I – is perfectly suited for this conversation, always helping me see the objective truth of how I am acting and helping me bring things into focus. She is bursting with wisdom on the subject so I though this would make for a very dynamic and hopefully helpful conversation for you.
Finally, it&#039;s only apropos that today (Monday July 21) also happens to be Julie&#039;s birthday. I didn&#039;t plan it that way, just a tiny example of how Julie seems to effortlessly roll in harmony.  So give her a shoutout on Twitter.  Or better yet, check out her newly launched website SriMati,com. If you dig where she&#039;s coming from, she will be posting spiritual nuggets, recipes and stories only the way she can tell them. Not to mention music. Don&#039;t forget to give her new album Jai Home a listen. The title track ends this week&#039;s episode.
Let&#039;s dive down this balance cave and see where it takes us.

Peace + Plants,

PS - I am newly obsessed with Snapchat. Last month the app launched a service called "My Story", which allows the user to post quick little videos. An early adopter, I have been posting my own "stories" every day or so for public viewing -- fun little amateurish snippets on training, food, nutrition and general family life. Some take you on a bike ride in the mountains. On trail runs and the places I travel. Others are just fun with the kids. So if you want to take a peek behind the scenes into our life in the form of a constantly disappearing vlog if you will (Snapchat "stories" only live for 24 hours before disappearing forever), download the Snapchat app to your smartphone and add me at: iamrichroll
PPS -- This is not a sponsor deal. I have no business relationship with Snapchat -- it's just a fun new way to create content and connect.

		<itunes:summary>Oh snap -- s*$%t is about to get real!
Back by popular demand, I am overjoyed to bring together two of my most popular repeat guests on the RRP -- John Joseph and Mishka Shubaly -- for an epic threesome.
Call it my Post-Punk Algonquin Round Table: uncensored ruminations NYC style on sobriety, writing books, eating plants, running ridiculously long distances, expanding consciousness, walking a spiritual path and PMA -- John&#039;s personal mantra for positive mental attitude.
I cannot overstate how much I love these guys. And on the mic they never disappoint.
As you might suspect, the Cro-Mags&#039; frontman aka Bloodclot returns to do what he does best -- incite, provoke, educate and entertain. Straight talk directly from the streets of the Lower East Side with one singular, driving purpose: getting people to &quot;wake the f&amp;*k up&quot;, expand consciousness and take control of our lives.
Not to be outdone, Mishka fills the co-host role today and holds his own with JJ (not easy), rounding out the conversation with his always humorous, astute observations on the creative, athletic, sober life.
But the predominant subject of today&#039;s show revolves around the release of John&#039;s new book -- a completely updated and rewritten version of his previously self-published cult hit: Meat Is For Pussies: A How To Guide For Dudes Who Want to Get Fit, Kick Ass and Take Names
If you&#039;re a long-time listener to the show, my boys need no introduction. If you&#039;re new and unfamiliar with these phenomenons, I urge you to check out my earlier introductory posts and tune into their multiple previous appearances (hyperlinks to previous shows in the below Notes).
As for JJ, suffice it to say the guy is a true American original.  Lower East Side thief, abuse survivor, drug dealer &amp; brawling gutter rat reborn as spiritual warrior. CBGB Street Poet. Punk-ass Robin Hood. Plantpowered Ironman. Spiritual evangelist.
A life story so astounding, I can only describe it like this: 

&quot;Take a little Charles Bukowski, add some Hugh Selby, Jr., throw in a little Jerry Stahl and finish it off with a light dusting of Paramahansa Yogananda. Then toss them all in a Martin Scorcese movie, douse the whole thing in kerosene and light it on fire. That is John Joseph.&quot;

But John is also one of the most spiritual, giving cats I have ever met. The guy who will always engage a stranger on the street; and literally move mountains to help a less fortunate soul in need -- and never ask for anything in return.
A the end of the day, all you really need to know about John is condensed into this little gem that recently appeared on Vice.com -- the most entertaining &quot;how to make a green smoothie&quot; video of all time:

Meditation; service; sobriety; GMO&#039;s; the &quot;V&quot; word; the nutritional plight of the everyman; balancing life as both an athlete and creative person; and what it means to truly be a man -- these are the topics of the day.  
And yes, we address head-on the heated controversy swirling around the title of John&#039;s new book. My opinion? This is a great book. It&#039;s not written for the converted. It&#039;s written for the guy who wouldn&#039;t pick up VegNews Magazine if it was the only thing left on the entire planet to read. This book will not be everyone&#039;s cup of tea. But it&#039;s a book I have no doubt will transform the lives of countless thousands. Because Meat Is For Pussies connects the dots for even the most hardened meat eating, carnivorous BBQ-loving dude imaginable.
It was my honor to write the foreword to this work. It was my honor to introduce John at his book release party in Brooklyn this week. And it is my honor to have Mishka and John join me today to discuss and celebrate his awesome achievement.  
I&#039;m proud to call these guys my friends and am always thrilled to bring their unique, compelling voices to you.
FINAL NOTE: This episode is EXPLICIT for profane language. John cannot and will not be edited or muzzled -- nor would you want him to be.</itunes:summary>

FINAL NOTE: This episode is EXPLICIT for profane language. John cannot and will not be edited or muzzled -- nor would you want him to be. He drops the f-bomb about a thousand times during the interview so if you are easily offended, I'm warning you now.  Let's just say it's NSFW -- so if the kiddies are around or you're at work, I might suggest popping the earbuds in.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the show.
Peace, Plants and -- in the words of John Joseph -- PMA!

I started this show because I truly believe that too many of us are wasting our lives in a reflexive daze. Disconnected from who we are, what makes our hearts beat and what we truly need to be happy. Just trying to make it through the day intact. Pay the bills. And make ends meet so we can numb out to Dancing With The Stars. Living for the weekend, we celebrate by getting drunk and then do it all over again. You know what I’m talking about.
It&#039;s no way to live. Believe me, I tried.
Remember when you were a kid? No older than 11 when the world was wide open. Everything was amazing. Even the tiniest of things could provoke endless fascination. Pure joy in the simplest of activities like running around in the yard with a garden hose; jumping off a diving board into a pool or riding your bike around the neighborhood with friends. The effortless ability to be truly present in the world. Gifted with an innate sense of wonder – and a moral compass that naturally understood right from wrong, good from bad.
Then we grow up. That child falls by the wayside. Drops away. Or simply becomes repressed as we morph out of that natural state of what it is to be fundamentally alive, only to step into the objective, material fear-based world of ego, status, and comparison that leaves us obsessed with the past and maniacally pre-occupied with the future yet never fully present in the now.
This is the chronic collective human condition today&#039;s guest calls being lost in the rational world. A state of being that all too often leaves us anxious, afraid, depressed, isolated, lonely and sometimes even desperate – resigned to a life we&#039;re not sure we ever really even signed up for.
I know what that’s like. I&#039;ve been there.  And so has today’s guest.
But there is a way out.  Because that inner child is still there – lurking deep down. We just have to find a way to access it. Tap in. Find a way to bring it to the surface. Unlock and unleash it.
This is the path to the authentic self. This is the path to wholeness. This is what it means to be alive. And happy – not in a blissed out unicorns kind of way but in the sense that your life has directed meaning – a purpose that brings true satisfaction.
SLOMO.
That’s right people. Slomo.
What the hell is a Slomo? It&#039;s not what. It&#039;s who.
I first became aware of this world class character when an award-winning short documentary about a very strange man by an enterprising young filmmaker named Josh Izenberg landed on the home page of the New York Times at the end of March.
What followed was 16 minutes of pure unadulterated awe-inspiring beauty about a man going boldly where most men fear to venture – letting go of all the trappings of his comfortable, previous existence to instead to pursue the simplest of lives. A life based on faith, purity, movement and the pursuit of what he calls &quot;The Zone&quot; – in his own highly unique and incredibly peculiar way.
I implore you – before listening to this episode, please watch this short documentary. The experience of our conversation just won&#039;t be complete without it.

Born John Kitchin, Slomo is a spry and vigorous 71-year old dude raised on a dairy farm in North Carolina. He was a top student at Duke and Wake Forest Medical School before building an incredibly successful neurology practice in Southern California.

"I think our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we’re run by maniacs for maniacal ends. I think they’re all insane. But I am liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That’s what’s insane about it."
John Lennon


I started this show because I truly believe that too many of us are wasting our lives in a reflexive daze. Disconnected from who we are, what makes our hearts beat and what we truly need to be happy. Just trying to make it through the day intact. Pay the bills. And make ends meet so we can numb out to Dancing With The Stars. Living for the weekend, we celebrate by getting drunk and then do it all over again. You know what I’m talking about.
It's no way to live. Believe me, I tried.
Remember when you were a kid? No older than 11 when the world was wide open. Everything was amazing. Even the tiniest of things could provoke endless fascination. Pure joy in the simplest of activities like running around in the yard with a garden hose; jumping off a diving board into a pool or riding your bike around the neighborhood with friends. The effortless ability to be truly present in the world. Gifted with an innate sense of wonder – and a moral compass that naturally understood right from wrong, good from bad.
Then we grow up. That child falls by the wayside. Drops away. Or simply becomes repressed as we morph out of that natural state of what it is to be fundamentally alive, only to step into the objective, material fear-based world of ego, status, and comparison that leaves us obsessed with the past and maniacally pre-occupied with the future yet never fully present in the now.
This is the chronic collective human condition today's guest calls being lost in the rational world. A state of being that all too often leaves us anxious, afraid, depressed, isolated, lonely and sometimes even desperate – resigned to a life we're not sure we ever really even signed up for.
I know what that’s like. I've been there.  And so has today’s guest.
But there is a way out.  Because that inner child is still there – lurking deep down. We just have to find a way to access it. Tap in. Find a way to bring it to the surface. Unlock and unleash it.
This is the path to the authentic self. This is the path to wholeness. This is what it means to be alive. And happy – not in a blissed out unicorns kind of way but in the sense that your life has directed meaning – a purpose that brings true satisfaction.
SLOMO.
That’s right people. Slomo.
What the hell is a Slomo? It's not what. It's who.
I first became aware of this world class character when an award-winning short documentary about a very strange man by an enterprising young filmmaker named Josh Izenberg landed on the home page of the New York Times at the end of March.
What followed was 16 minutes of pure unadulterated awe-inspiring beauty about a man going boldly where most men fear to venture – letting go of all the trappings of his comfortable, previous existence to instead to pursue the simplest of lives. A life based on faith, purity, movement and the pursuit of what he calls "The Zone" – in his own highly unique and incredibly peculiar way.
I implore you – before listening to this episode, please watch this short documentary. The experience of our conversation just won't be complete without it.

Born John Kitchin, Slomo is a spry and vigorous 71-year old dude raised on a dairy farm in North Carolina. He was a top student at Duke and Wake Forest Medical School before building an incredibly successful neurology practice in Southern California. The kind of wild success that begets BMW’s, Ferarris, multiple mansions and even a Neverland Ranch-esque exotic animal farm.
The kind of success that can, well, in the words of Slomo, make you an asshole.
And by his own admission, that’s exactly what John Kitchin was – an asshole.
Then something happened. A strange confluence of events that included a random encounter with a 91-year old patient and – quite ironically -- the onset of his own neurological disorder that compelled him to take a long hard look at how he was pursuing his short time here on Earth.
Victimized by a rare and strange condition called Prosopagnosia – that weird thing you might have heard of where suddenly you simply cannot recognize faces anymore made famous by Dr. Oliver Sacks and shared by people like Kurt Vonnegut, Tom Stoppard and artist Chuck Close (one of my favorites) -- Kitchin found himself in a twist of irony a novelist would envy.
Neurologically impaired, the neurologist became the neurology patient.
What could have been perceived as a disastrous turn of events instead became John’s moment of truth. His line in the sand moment. A door cracked open, he saw it as a sacred, divinely inspired opportunity -- and seized it.
Unable to continue his former life, he quit his job. Then he sold all of his possessions.  The Ferrari and the BMW? Gone. The exotic animal farm? Bye bye. The mansions? Sold. Then he moved to a tiny one room studio apartment ½ block from the Pacific Beach boardwalk in San Diego.
But this was no mere downsizing or simple self-promise to slow down and start smelling the roses.  It was a decision to become an entirely new person altogether. A firm commitment to pursue the remainder of his days based upon one singular, fundamental premise:
Do what you love.
For John, this edict translated to one very specific activity: skating.
That's right. Rollerblading.  All day.  Every day.
Exit John.  Enter Slomo.
Developing a unique and admittedly bizarre slow motion gliding style that looks like a flying Warrior 3 yoga pose, Slomo found himself inhabiting a rare state of consciousness he dubs "The Zone" – a deep meditative state where both time and objectivity become fluid, amorphous constructs. A certain sense of transcendence catalyzed by the lateral motion of his body impacting the tiny bones of his inner ear that dictate the body's innate sense of balance. A self-styled moving meditation that allows him to tap into what spiritualist Eckhart Tolle would call The Power of Now. Or as Slomo would put it, riding the tip of the great iceberg of consciousness.
It's this practice that ultimately allowed Slomo to overcome his assholeness and become happy. Truly happy.  Some might even say too happy for comfort -- or at least polite company.
15 years later Slomo is a Pacific Beach fixture. Most beachcombers likely assume he is some kind of crazy homeless guy with a mental disorder. Maybe a VA hospital cast away. But definitely a little nuts.
In truth, Slomo is a revered treasure of this idyllic beach community. Communal property, protected and beloved by all who call this seaside enclave home.
I like to think of Slomo as a boardwalk monk. A western version of the Hindi saddhus that inhabit the caves high in the Himalayas, deep in meditation. A now simple man practicing his spin (pun intended) on what it means to pursue a higher state of consciousness – or what some like to call enlightenment.
Sound crazy? Maybe. But according to Slomo -- and John Lennon -- it’s everyone else that’s crazy.
From lost in the rational world to the tip of the great iceberg of consciousness, it's my honor and pleasure to bring you Slomo's story. So let’s dive deep down this crazy rabbit hole and see where it leads.
I hope you enjoy the listen.
Peace + Plants,

PS - The Slomo documentary seems to have catalyzed an interesting and relevant philosophical debate about the propriety of pursuing life based on this "do what you love" premise. For a counterpoint perspective, check out this opinion piece in the New York Times by Gordon Marino entitled, "A Life Beyond 'Do What You Love'."

		<itunes:summary>Today we’re back with some heavy nutrition talk!
There is so much confusion out there about diet, food &amp; optimal health. It&#039;s enough to make even the most discerning, conscientious consumer’s head split wide open in frustration. Exasperated, we end up simply paralyzed -- continuing to perpetuate unhealthy eating habits that enslave us to an inevitable future of disease, obesity and dependence upon the pharmaceutical industry.
My humble opinion? Last week&#039;s Time Magazine cover story on the comeback of butter doesn&#039;t exactly help matters. Seriously?
To help set matters to rights and slice through the wide swath of confusion, obfuscation and downright misinformation, I am pleased to host the lovely and sagacious Sharon Palmer RD. For the uninitiated, &quot;RD&quot; stands for Registered Dietitian. But a more apropos professional acronym just might be &quot;PPRD&quot; – for PlantPowered Registered Dietitian.
Sharon is the editor of the award-winning health newsletter Environmental Nutrition, and a nationally recognized nutrition expert who has personally impacted thousands of people’s lives through her writing and clinical work. She is the author of The Plant-Powered Diet: The Lifelong Eating Plan For Achieving Optimal Health, Starting Today and her new book Plant-Powered For Life: Eat Your Way to Lasting Health with 52 Simple Steps and 125 Delicious Recipes comes out on July 8 (available now for pre-order). These are books that empower everyone -- whether vegan, vegetarian, or omnivorous -- to put that Plantpower manifesto into practice by adopting a largely or entirely whole-foods, plant-based diet and thereby reaping such benefits as weight loss, optimal health, and longer life.
Indeed, the Plantpower / Plant-Power meme isn&#039;t just alive and well, it&#039;s picking up steam.
What&#039;s great about Sharon is her easy-to-grasp, personal approach to food and diet, an approach that marshals the most up-to-date findings in nutrition to explain both why you should eat more plant-based fare and exactly how to do so.
But more interesting that that (to me at least) is our dialog about transcending diet altogether. The idea that true wellness stems from adopting a more long-term, sustainable, holistic mind-body-spirit lifestyle approach to not only what you put in your mouth, but how you spend your time and actually live on a day-to-day basis.  
This is the approach that changed my life. The approach I do my best to embody daily. And the approach I continue to rely and fall back upon to keep my life balanced and in check (with varying degrees of success I might add). So it was great to hear Sharon echo this perspective.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.  If you do, tell a friend!
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>Must be nice to have your life [sneer]......I wish I could.... [fill in the blank, with scorn]....but some people have to work for a living [biting sarcasm].
The easy road is to resent those that have what you want. Or at least more of what you wish you had. Actually it&#039;s more of a cop out than an easy road. But a cop out most of us take (usually unconsciously), which in turn leads to nothing good.
Envy, anger, denial, self-loathing and defeatism are but a few of the common and predictable human emotions most likely to arise by default when confronted with that rare person living a fully actualized, aspirational life. A rewarding life where work and play are merged. A life that from the outside makes everything appear smooth, easy and obstacle free.
You know the kind of guy I&#039;m talking about right? Guys with names like Elon, Biz and LeBron. How annoying!
I get it. But I also understand that annoyance is just a mild form of resentment. And resentment is an emotional luxury I personally can&#039;t afford. Because it inevitably leads me to a place of deep suffering. Meanwhile, the object of my deep resentment remains blissfully unaware of my inner turmoil, continuing that envious life of authentic expression unperturbed and none the wiser. All the more maddening!
So begins the downward shame spiral.
Now let&#039;s try a different tactic.  Instead of foisting negative energy outward upon this unassuming third person, let&#039;s instead turn that powerful forefinger around -- the one that loves to point and judge. Instead, let&#039;s look within with honesty. Let&#039;s accept where we are and invest in the plausibility of a positive new, forward moving trajectory. Let&#039;s take action based on belief in your own personal potential and deservedness. And let&#039;s embrace the process of unlocking and expressing your best, most authentic self to the fullest of your abilities.
Yeah I know. Easier said than done.
This is where today&#039;s guest comes in. Not because he&#039;s going to give you some version of &quot;10 Steps To Live Your Dream Life&quot; (for the record I can&#039;t stand articles that involve numerical lists, but I digress).  But rather because sometimes a good old fashioned inspirational story well told is just about the most powerful thing imaginable when it comes to catalyzing positive change. A seismic shift in how we contemplate our lives, behave and interact with our environment and others that can lead us on new trajectories that permanently change our lives for the better.
Daren Flitcroft
I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll say it again.  It&#039;s fun to have well known people on the podcast. I know that I will get more downloads and rise up the iTunes charts when I host a celebrated guest with a huge following. That&#039;s cool, but that&#039;s not really what this mission is all about.
The real joy is introducing you guys to someone you have never heard of.  Someone you might otherwise never encounter your entire life. From an uninformed perspective just an average person we can all relate to, navigating life on life&#039;s terms. Struggling with the same things we all grapple with -- finances, health, personal satisfaction, relationships, you name it.
But someone I find special. And inspiring.
Daren fits the bill.
When he arrived at UCLA from Washington, D.C. in the fall of 2008 as a young scholarship athlete, everything seemed to be falling into place for Daren. Just another step closer in the unfoldment of his dream: becoming a professional soccer player.  But Daren&#039;s vision ended abruptly when he suffered a career-ending injury. Adding insult to this injury? It occurred before he ever played a single college game.
Most people would have crumbled. But instead of falling apart, resorting to anger, resentment and self-defeatism, Daren took stock of his life, channeled his latent ambition, and quickly set about pursuing a new dream.  A way to continue his love for soccer by pursuing a career in professional athlete representation. I&#039;m not saying it was easy,</itunes:summary>

Just another step closer in the unfoldment of his dream: becoming a professional soccer player.  But Daren's vision ended abruptly when he suffered a career-ending injury. Adding insult to this injury? It occurred before he ever played a single college game.
Most people would have crumbled. But instead of falling apart, resorting to anger, resentment and self-defeatism, Daren took stock of his life, channeled his latent ambition, and quickly set about pursuing a new dream.  A way to continue his love for soccer by pursuing a career in professional athlete representation. I'm not saying it was easy, but shortly after he graduated from UCLA, Daren fulfilled his dream by becoming a "young turk" sports agent at Wasserman Media Group -- one of the world's most prestigious sports agencies.
Today Daren scours the country looking for emerging professional soccer talent.  And when he isn't working, he's running.  A veteran of many a marathon, Daren completed his first ultra earlier this month at The North Face 50 in Sterling, Virginia.
We talk about it all.  College and professional soccer (oh so apropos given that we're in the midst of World Cup right now), the agent's perspective on what distinguishes a good athletic prospect from superstar potential, what it takes to identify, pursue and achieve your dreams, and how Daren rediscovered athletic satisfaction through running.
Oh yeah, he's also plant-based. Don't think we don't talk about that, because we totally do. And all sorts of other cool stuff too.
In any event, Daren is a great guy with a compelling, inspirational message. One of the good guys.
It was a pleasure getting to know him better and I am so happy to share his story with you. I sincerely hope you enjoy it.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>You care about the planet, right?
Of course you do. We&#039;re all concerned about global climate change, melting ice caps, fracking, the pollution of our oceans and all the many more issues we currently face that threaten Earth&#039;s long term sustainable health.
As such, we do our best to be good planetary citizens. To keep our carbon footprint light, we eat local, recycle and compost. We opt for the bike and leave the hybrid car in the garage to reduce our fossil fuel dependance. We&#039;ve swapped our lightbulbs for those new expensive ones that for whatever reason are supposed to be so much better. And here in California (and wherever we face drought) we limit our showers and curtail excess water usage.
This is a very positive shift in consciousness. These are all great habits. So go ahead. It&#039;s OK to feel good about yourself. In fact, give yourself a pat on the back for being awesome.
But what if I told you that all of our individual good citizenship efforts are just the tiniest drop in the bucket when compared to the massively deleterious impact of just one particular industry most of us quite simply and unconsciously support on a daily basis every day of our lives?
Whether we are talking about global climate change, the blindingly rapid destruction of our rain forests, over consumption of water, species extinction, the depletion and destruction of our soil, the pollution of our rivers, lakes and oceans or the obliteration of natural wildlife habitats, you might be surprised to discover the very inconvenient and uncomfortable truth that there is one industry single-handedly responsible for destroying and undermining the health and sustainability of our planet far more than any other.
The elephant in the room – animal agriculture.
It is indisputable that our global industrialized system of factory livestock harvesting is unsustainable. It&#039;s killing us and it&#039;s killing the planet. We must embrace this reality and work collectively to create new sustainable systems to feed the 7 billion people that walk the Earth.  Because the point of no return is quickly upon us.  We&#039;re in the red. If we don&#039;t promptly redirect, it truly will be too late.
When it comes to conservation and ecological responsibility, the dialog generally focuses on fossil fuels. A big issue, of course; and worthy of our attention. But here&#039;s a truth that all too often gets quietly swept under the rug: the deleterious environmental impacts of animal agriculture dwarf the impacts of fossil fuel demand in every single category across the board.
So why aren&#039;t we talking about it?
This is the question explored by Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret -- an incredibly sobering and powerful upcoming documentary that takes a hard, unflinching look at just why the issue of animal agriculture and its incomprehensibly negative impact fails to get the airtime it deserves in the global environmentalism conversation.  Imagine An Inconvenient Truth meets Blackfish and you get the picture.

Today on the podcast I am so excited to have the filmmakers here to tell us all about what is really going on -- Keegan Kuhn and Kip Andersen.
We truly are all connected on this small blue planet. And as such, no discussion about individual health in the micro is complete without conversation about global health in the macro. We have a collective responsibility to remove the blinders of denial, take the red pill from the Matrix, understand what is truly at play and marshall our planetary citizenship to catalyze the change this planet, our children and all its inhabitants deserve -- before it&#039;s too late.
I sincerely hope this conversation challenges you and gives you something to really ponder.  And I encourage all of you to go out and see this film when it comes to a city near you.  And as always, let me know what you think in the comments section below.

		<itunes:summary>Imagine this: you are a practicing pediatric ER doctor; all day long every day you treat kids that are not just overweight, but obese.  More than obese, these kids are sick -- really sick.
What do you do?
Well, you can do what most doctors do – tell the kids to ditch the salt, sugar and fat; swap the video games for some fresh air; maybe prescribe some medication for the cholesterol or blood pressure; then move on to the next patient. No time to linger....
Or you can take a harder road. Despite a fellowship at Harvard Medical School, full time employment as an emergency room pediatrician, and editor of 3 medical textbooks, Dr. Sujit Sharma felt the need to do more. It was time to try something new: address the cause; focus on prevention; identify and provide doable, sustainable solutions that actually work.
Radical!
It was around this time that Dr. Sanjay Gupta -- Sujit&#039;s longtime University of Michigan buddy and yes, the guy from CNN -- introduced Sujit to his friend Ladell Hill -- a molecular health specialist, herbalist, fitness trainer and wellness expert who had been spent the last 20 years researching and experimenting with nutrition. A passion for healing Ladell inherited as legacy from his Native American grandfather.
When he wasn&#039;t training celebrities like Gwen Stefani &amp; Lenny Kravitz, Ladell studied tirelessly for years to understand how to best apply the wisdom of his grandfather to his modern practice of health and wellness. He came to realize that science now substantiated much of what he learned from his grandfather: the power of an indigenous, whole food plant-based diet to not only promote overall well being and wellness optimization but to also expedite physiological recovery from exercise induced stress and even -- in certain cases -- prevent and reverse disease.
Bold and powerful, particularly when you get a glimpse of Ladell, who at almost 50 sports jacked guns and the physique a 26 year old NFL running back would envy.
Sujit and Ladell immediately hit it off. The result of their collaboration, combined expertise and passion is Chuice -- a brand new category of food product that can only be explained as chewable juice.
Chewable juice?!? Say what? Bizarre, right? I was skeptical. But I&#039;ve tried it and it&#039;s great - a mastication of nuts and seeds plus fruit and vegetable juice with all the fiber, every ingredient chosen for a specific cellular benefit -- it&#039;s like a delicious, super easily digestible whole food meal in a bottle.
Disclaimer: This is not a paid endorsement or an advertisement of any kind. I have absolutely no business, financial, sponsorship, affiliate or other incentivized relationship with Chuice whatsoever. I just like these guys and find their mission worthy of discussion.
A couple months ago, Sanjay introduced me to Sujit and Ladell simply because he thought we would hit it off. Out of courtesy to Sanjay, I ended up calling Sujit a couple days later thinking we would have a cordial few minutes on the phone.  Instead we spoke for almost two hours -- dialoging on everything to wellness, to plant-based nutrition to the state of medicine and disease prevention. At at that moment I knew I needed to meet Ladell and have these guys on the show.
They do not disappoint -- a fascinating deep dive into the state of nutrition education in medical school; the ills of our current healthcare system; the potency and power of plants to prevent and heal disease; and a culminating call to action to return to the natural.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the listen.

		<itunes:summary>When I use the word “best&quot; in reference to my guests, I mean it.
Today&#039;s guest truly earns the adjective.  If you follow the sport of competitive swimming, then this woman needs no introduction. Quite simply put, Rebecca Soni is one of the most accomplished athletes in the world, period. Here are just a few of her notables:

2-time Olympian (2008 / 2012)
6-time Olympic medalist
Multiple world record holder
1st woman to earn back to back Olympic Gold Medals in the 200-meter breaststroke
Broke the World Record in the 200-meter breaststroke in consecutive Olympiads (2008 / 2012)
First woman in history to break the 2:20 barrier in the 200-meter breaststroke
6-time NCAA Champion at USC
2x &quot;World Swimmer Of The Year&quot; (2010 &amp; 2011)

In other words, don&#039;t mess with Reb. But meet her on the street and you&#039;d never know just how badass she is -- her sweetNESS and genuine humility simply won&#039;t allow it.
If you know me, you know swimming is my first love. So anytime I get the chance to talk on the subject, it’s going to be long -- sorry just can&#039;t help it.  This conversation holds true, running at around 2 ½ hours. So I&#039;m breaking the interview up into 2 parts.  Part 1 today (Sunday night -- 6.1.14); Part 2 will post sometime Thursday -- 6.5.14.
Good stuff. A compelling journey through the the ups and downs of Rebecca’s unparalleled career, we dig deep into:

The mental aspects of peak performance, including Rebecca&#039;s personal struggles;
Rebecca&#039;s early years as a young swimmer in New Jersey raised by Hungarian immigrants;
The important role of coaches have played in her career;
Social media pressures on the global Olympic stage;
Her perspective on being a positive role model for young women;
Her evolving perspective on nutrition &amp; new found embrace of the plant-based lifestyle;
The performance impacts of different modalities of training (volume vs. intensity);
Her transition from celebrity athlete to civilian retirement; and
Atlas Ventures - Rebecca&#039;s start up with fellow Olympian Ariana Kukors devoted to &quot;brain training&quot; the next generation of champion athletes.

&quot;Legend&quot; is a word that gets bandied about all too loosely these days.  But Rebecca more than earns the mantle and the respect the term truly deserves. She is a legend in the truest sense and her legacy in sport will more than stand the test of time. 
Plus, she&#039;s super cool. After the show she hung out at our house with my kids and her dog Cody (you can hear him hanging around the pod in the background), let us play around with her gold medals and was basically just a delight.
It was an honor to spend a few hours with her and couldn’t be more pleased to bring this conversation to you.  I sincerely hope you enjoy it!
Peace + Plants,

PS - Here&#039;s my friend John Brenkus of ESPN&#039;s Sports Science breaking down just what makes Rebecca&#039;s breaststroke technique so, well, unique:

	<itunes:subtitle>Today we delve into an entirely new world. The world of tea. I can hear you now: Tea?? Really? Why should I care about tea? I&#039;ve been enjoying the podcast a lot lately, Rich.  But I&#039;m not sure about this...</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>Today we delve into an entirely new world. The world of tea.
I can hear you now: Tea?? Really? Why should I care about tea? I&#039;ve been enjoying the podcast a lot lately, Rich.  But I&#039;m not sure about this...I think you might have lost the thread this week. 
A couple years ago I would have probably said the same thing. I don&#039;t feel that way anymore. So if you are thinking of skipping this episode because on the surface it doesn&#039;t sound like something you are interested in, reconsider. Because -- and as I always say -- contempt prior to investigation imprisons one to everlasting ignorance.
WuDe.
Born in the United States as Aaron Daniel Fisher, Wude was drawn to the East from a very early age. After studying philosophy in college, he travelled the world and ultimately settled in Taiwan, where he has since become a Buddhist monk – steeped in the sutras and wisdom of that tradition – as well as a tea master – a vituoso of not just the living tradition of harvesting tea, but the living tradition of what tea means in a sort of meta sense – why it’s important and why we should care about it.
Tea as medicine. Tea as healing. Tea as life.
Tea Practice as Zen.
The easiest way to put it is that WuDe comes from this idea that tea is a universal living, breathing thing that unifies us all -- the tree of life.
Think of tea as a metaphor. A foundational concept around which to structure a set of ancient teachings, principles, knowledge and wisdom to glean a broader truth about health, healing, community, the environment, life, life’s meaning and the unifying oneness – or undeniable interconnectedness of everything
In Taiwan WuDe founded and runs Global Tea Hut -- a school and center devoted to the education and preservation of the ancient tradition of harvesting living tea and welcomes people from all over the world to come study and practice tea preparation, meditation, tea history, tea crafting, the sutras of tea and its relevance in society, and how to cultivate the Dao of Tea as a method of spiritual expansion.
I realize today&#039;s guest and these topics may be slightly off your personal reservation. That&#039;s cool - it was for me initially as well. All I ask is that you set aside whatever preconceived notions you may be harboring and enter this episode with an open mind. Do that, and I assure you will come out the other side with not only a new and informed view on the import of tea, but a greater understanding of Zen. An expanded perspective on consciousness. And a heightened awareness of the oneness that unites us all.
WuDe spills over with crazy mad wisdom that more than merits your attention and contemplation.
I promise this just might be the most fascinating conversation you will hear all week.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the show.  Let me know what you think in the comments below!
Peace + Plants,

Bullshit.
I have the great honor of seeing and participating in lives that have changed so dramatically the people they are today bear almost no resemblance to who they once were.  
Weight loss, sure - I see that all the time. I&#039;m talking more about drastic career changes; dramatic spiritual awakenings; and impossible recovery from profound addictions. I&#039;m talking about people who change from that person you’d shuffle across the street to avoid – literal mental insanity – to becoming inspirational leaders among men. Alterations so stunning I&#039;m left awestruck; and with a profound sense that there must be powers at work beyond the mere mortal.
If this show is anything, it&#039;s an effort to share those stories to inspire that kind of hope, aspiration and possibility in you. That no matter what your circumstance or plight in life, that transcending the obstacles you face is within reach.
When I recorded the introduction to this episode and wrote down these thoughts, it was 3:30 am. Jetlagged and wide awake, I just returned from a whirlwind trip across the globe – 3 weeks on the road in Canada, Beirut, Lebanon and all across Saudi Arabia. Riyadh in the heart of the Arabian desert, Al Khobar on the Persian Gulf &amp; Jeddah on the Red Sea.  If you follow me on Instagram or Facebook you might have seem some pictures of me running in all those places. Apologies for all the selfies, but I just wanted to share what I was experiencing with everyone. It was such a fantastic journey and privilege to see parts of the world I never in a million years thought I would ever have the opportunity to see.
I gave 6 talks over the course of the trip; all in their own right amazing. Particularly in the Middle East, where the cultural divide can seem so profound and impenetrable that making a true connection seemed almost impossible.
And yet to connect with people on a fundamental level over things and concerns we all share no matter what the dictates of our cultural prerogatives – our health, the health of our children, nutrition, prevention of disease, fitness and the ills of our food system ecosystem – was life altering for me. I know it made it impact on them as well.
It feels really good. An experience I am immensely grateful for. An experience I won&#039;t soon forget.
My point is that I have changed. Dramatically and irrevocably. Mostly in ways I didn’t expect. Could never have predicted. And certainly never dreamed, consciously plotted or specifically devised. But definitely in ways I embrace and love.
For most of my life, all I wanted was to be someone else. And now I can say that I would not trade my life for anyone.
It all started when I made a decision to do the inside work. As I got healthier -- physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually -- I learned, very slowly and stubbornly I might add, how to lean into, trust and take action on my (once dubious and self-will driven) instincts, no matter how illogical or contrary to my chosen life path they may have seemed at the time.
This has made all the difference.  It is the reason I enjoy the life I have today.
It begins with mining your personal truth. And then embarking on the journey of living it. Something I want everyone to experience -- and why I do this show.
If today’s guest is anything, he is a guy who is living his truth. Living his own unique brand of passion. Walking a road less traveled, and inspiring people the world over.
Timothy Shieff.
Otherwise known as Livewire, Timothy is widely considered one of the world’s best (if not the best) Freerunners. More commonly referred to as parkour (although I have since discovered there is a difference), Timothy specializes in doing the kind of thing you see in the Jason Bourne and James Bond movies -- running up walls, jumping off roofs and generally defying gravity and the laws of physics with nothing but incredible skill, laser sharp coordination, impossible body strength,</itunes:summary>

Timothy Shieff.
Otherwise known as Livewire, Timothy is widely considered one of the world’s best (if not the best) Freerunners. More commonly referred to as parkour (although I have since discovered there is a difference), Timothy specializes in doing the kind of thing you see in the Jason Bourne and James Bond movies -- running up walls, jumping off roofs and generally defying gravity and the laws of physics with nothing but incredible skill, laser sharp coordination, impossible body strength, and the mere momentum of his body.
This is a long way of saying that this proper and polite young English lad can do things you can’t. Mind-bending, mind-blowing body movements that have made him a superstar in his chosen subculture and beyond.
But quite honestly, Timothy's athletic skill -- and his interesting relationship with fear that allows him to place himself in situations most wouldn't dare -- is secondary to his indefatigable drive to inspire others the world over towards self betterment through the incredible transformative power of body movement.
Additionally passionate about the planet, Timothy's discipline can be described as a form of physical, quasi-political performance art – a demonstration of how we can live more in harmony with nature and our immediate surroundings. A reframing of what a building, rooftop, curb or staircase railing actually means by inverting and expanding upon the possibilities in which a human being can interact with it.
On top of all of this, Timothy is 100% plant-based. An ardent vegan and close friend &amp; cohort of Jamie Oliver, Tim shares his many opinions on the subject, which just might make you rethink a few traditional assumptions about the relationship between nutrition and extraordinary athletic performance. Particularly as it relates to an athlete of his kind, where explosiveness, power, speed, incredible body strength and precise coordination dictate everything. And draw the line between astounding feats and mortal injury.
But more than any of this, it's Tim's spirit that moves me, and why I'm so proud to have him on today's show. 
The first line of his website bio says it all: I'm a Human practicing Being. His stunning high-gloss music video-esque 2014 Showreel says the rest - it's an absolute show stopper:

In any event, I found out Tim was visiting Los Angeles from his native UK when my buddy Mac Danzig (MMA/UFC fighter who guested in RRP #45) texted me and said I had to meet Tim.  I was super busy at the time and didn't think I would be able to make it work. Then the next day I ran into my Ninja Warrior buddy Travis Brewer (also a former guest on RRP #70) who told me he had been training with Tim that day.
The universe was making it clear – I had to meet this guy.
So I made the time. I'm so glad I did. 
Travis also sits down with us to co-host today and we dug in. Here's Tim jumping across my roof before we sat down for the chat.  Unbelievable.

I genuinely hope you enjoy the conversation.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>Unless you are a new listener to the show, then you very well may be fatigued by my show opening mantra.  If so, you&#039;re out of luck, because I&#039;m going to repeat it here anyway:
Each week I bring you the best most forward thinking, paradigm busting minds in health, fitness, athleticism, creativity, diet, nutrition, art, entrepreneurship, personal growth &amp; spirituality….
The goal is simple: to empower YOU with the tools, the knowledge, the inspiration and motivation to take your life to the next level. To help you discover, unlock and unleash your BEST most AUTHENTIC self.
I repeat it here because it&#039;s particularly relevant to today&#039;s guest and topic.  
I repeat it here because I need to remind myself that in order to make that leap to so unlock and unleash, I must say yes to experiences outside my comfort zone.  I must be and remain open to new ideas that are unfamiliar. I must continue to be willing to risk.  And I must be willing to experience things that still scare me.
There is a truism I find myself repeating under my breath: you cannot transmit something you haven&#039;t got.  
In other words, if I hope to so transmit, by way of this podcast, the inspiration and tools I profess to offer, then I must walk that talk. Otherwise I strike a false chord - my words become inauthentic. And this house I bled to build becomes a mere house of cards, soon to fall in upon itself.
After a rewarding 7 days in Ontario with Julie, I’m now traveling alone -- in the midst of this extraordinary speaking tour across the Middle East -- Beirut, Lebanon and three cities across Saudi Arabia: Riyadh, Jeddah and Al Khobar.
Traveling to this part of the world intimidates me. Is it safe? Can I go outside and run without negative repercussion? And how will I and my message be received by cultures so different from my own?
I love traveling. I can think of few things that excite me more than getting on a plane for a very long flight to some exotic place I have never before seen.  And yet, I am definitely well outside my comfort zone. These are not places that I would ordinarily choose to visit. But that&#039;s what makes it so enthralling. I am wide open to the multitude of opportunities they potentially offer.
It&#039;s about practicing &quot;yes&quot; to the new experiences that present themselves, irrespective of whatever feelings of fear, insecurity, doubt and anxiety that creep up and strive to keep my life small for the sake of comfort and security -- emotions I know are underpinned by illusion - what the Hindus call Maya.
For me, the practice of saying yes in the face of such fear and doubt has been paying dividends of late.
I can&#039;t tell you what an incredible experience Beirut has been the last few days. A place in so many ways vastly different from what I expected. Imagine a mashup of old and new. Cote D’Azur meets Arabia. Parts almost indistinguishable from Milan or Paris or Tuscany – très chic European, sophisticated and urban teeming with beautiful, intelligent, curious people I had the privilege of spending time with. There&#039;s a reason it&#039;s called The Paris of the Middle East.
But turn your head to peer behind my lovely hotel on the waterfront and you will see the unmistakable scars of war. The scaffold of the towering old Holiday Inn hotel – once the pride and pearl of the city -- looms high yet decimated and rife with bullet indentations and gaping holes from shell fire artillery blasts. Demolished just after construction was completed when the civil war broke out on 1975, the scaffold still stands in a state of utter disreapir as a constant reminder of a different time, and the ever-present instability that underpins the city&#039;s elegant, cosmopolitan veneer.
As I sit here tonight finishing up this post, I am now writing from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. More on this city in a later post, but for now I will just say that I spent an evening in a beautiful private home delivering my message to a small group of 15 Saudi businessmen dressed in traditional thobe </itunes:summary>

As I sit here tonight finishing up this post, I am now writing from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. More on this city in a later post, but for now I will just say that I spent an evening in a beautiful private home delivering my message to a small group of 15 Saudi businessmen dressed in traditional thobe attire, some accompanied by their wives. The cultural divide at first struck me as almost impenetrable. I am not well versed in the cultural etiquette. I don't know the rules here! Can I address the women or must I not make eye contact? Will I offend them with my message? There is no way these people are going to be even the slightest bit interested in what I have to offer.  
For a moment I was terrified. I have never before felt further from home -- and I've been to Pakistan! Then I closed my eyes. Took a breath. Consciously surrendered to the moment. Asked to be simply a channel for service.  Nothing more, nothing less. And then let it all go.
Relief.
Now in the moment, the cultural divide vanished. And by the end of the evening, I felt completely at home -- because I was.
It was an incredible experience.  And one I will not soon forget.
As I sit here tonight, I am in touch with the miraculous and impossibly beautiful turns my life has taken.
How did this happen? By learning how to say yes -- not just to opportunities that once would have scared me, but to myself -- my higher self. To the inner, instinctual voice I have -- through years of inside work -- come to trust as my ultimate life navigator.  Because the voice does not divine from what I think of as me, but from something higher.  What Julie would call Divine Consciousness.
How did this happen? By choosing above all -- to echo a mantra evoked by filmmaker Casey Neistat in a previous episode to invest in experience.
Reflecting on all of this, I am enriched -- for these experiences have made me better, broader, more expanded and compassionate.
But most of all, I am grateful.
Gratitude. 
It’s been a while, but Julie is now back in the copilot seat for today's show, and gratitude is the subject of the hour.  
This is a good one people. Be open. Choose to invest in this experience. And say yes to receiving information that might be new to you.
And stick around through the end -- you won't want to miss Julie's beautiful rendition of her song Cry.
I hope you enjoy the offering.

		<itunes:summary>Today were back with Ultraman competitor and EPIC5 finisher Christian Isakson for Part 2 of our conversation.
Thanks for all the great comments and feedback I received on social media this week in response to Part 1. If you haven’t listened to that one yet dial it up first before tuning in here
Part 2 just gets better. We delve into Christian&#039;s racing. He walks us through his first-hand experience completing EPIC5 and what it took to put his imprimatur on last year&#039;s Ultraman World Championships.
Then we turn to service. Christian&#039;s commitment to giving back through his involvement with Chris Lieto&#039;s non-profit More Than Sport and and his recent work in Kenya with Ameena Project.  And how faith, family and humility are keystones to remain grounded, focused and on point.
The message is this -- if you want your life to have true meaning, satisfaction, fulfillment and a legacy of value, giving back in a meaningful way is essential.
If you are feeling adrift, Christian&#039;s message will help right your ship.

		<fullsummary>Today were back with Ultraman competitor and EPIC5 finisher Christian Isakson for Part 2 of our conversation.
Thanks for all the great comments and feedback I received on social media this week in response to Part 1. If you haven’t listened to that one yet dial it up first before tuning in here
Part 2 just gets better. We delve into Christian's racing. He walks us through his first-hand experience completing EPIC5 and what it took to put his imprimatur on last year's Ultraman World Championships.
Then we turn to service. Christian's commitment to giving back through his involvement with Chris Lieto's non-profit More Than Sport and and his recent work in Kenya with Ameena Project.  And how faith, family and humility are keystones to remain grounded, focused and on point.
The message is this -- if you want your life to have true meaning, satisfaction, fulfillment and a legacy of value, giving back in a meaningful way is essential.
If you are feeling adrift, Christian's message will help right your ship. If he has inspired you to seek out a more fulfilling path for yourself but you're just not sure how to embark on your own version of his story, then -- as mentioned in the introduction to this episode -- you might be encouraged by my new online course on MindBodyGreen.com entitled The Art of Living With Purpose - 2+ hours of streaming video content with an array of downloadable tools I learned, honed and devised to course correct my life -- tools I continue to rely on to this day to keep my life focused and on track.

		<itunes:summary>Today&#039;s guest is a guy I relate to on so many levels. Like a big Venn diagram of overlapping circles -- ultra-endurance multi-sport athlete, dad, husband, Ultraman competitor and EPIC5 finisher.
Today&#039;s guest is unique in that he is the only guy I have ever had on the show who, like me, has competed in both the Ultraman World Championships and EPIC5 (not that there are very many of us - I think only a few).
Today’s guest is also unique for his strong sense of faith, directed purpose and commitment to giving back in service to others the blessings bestowed upon him.
Today’s guest is Christian Isakson.
Christian and I first connected online several years ago on the eve of his 2011 attempt on EPIC5 (one year after I completed that challenge). Christian absolutely rocked it, completing the distance within the five day period I strived for, yet fell short. In the wake of that effort, I vividly recall several conversations in which I encouraged him to ply his trade at Ultraman. Ironically, Christian was unsure -- at the time not yet wholly confident in his abilities despite the potential I clearly saw in him. Yet he obliged. To be clear, not because of me - I just gave him a nudge. And at this past year&#039;s World Championship in Hawaii, he proved his mettle and then some. His race was far from perfect, but Christian more than distinguished himself as a future contender for the top podium spot, putting his imprimatur on the race with a stunning Day 2 bike effort that had him leading the field for the majority of the brutal 170-mile day.
Since our first Facebook exchange, Christian and I have been e-mail pen pals and phone buddies -- corresponding consistently over the years about everything from balancing parenting &amp; marriage to nutrition, training strategies, racing, the role of faith and most importantly service -- how best to give this whole ultra-endurance experience greater meaning for others beyond mere race results.
And yet Christian and I had never actually met in person. But no matter -- from our first conversation we have been close; meeting in person existing as nothing more than a formality. All that changed a few weeks ago when Christian came down to Los Angeles for a short overnight visit with me and my family. The hug he gave me when I picked him up at the airport just made our brotherhood official.
Today we sit down and sift through it all – the pain, passion, love and faith that fuels and drives him. The unique push-pull allure of ultra-distance racing. And how he balances this brutally demanding lifestyle to maintain a healthy and happy marriage, great relationship with his kids, and a rewarding career as a paramedic / firefighter.
But what makes Christian really tick is his faith. His fidelity to his church. And how service plays into his success equation – from his endeavors with various church organizations to his involvement with Chris Lieto&#039;s non-profit More Than Sport and Ameena Project – an NGO which took him to Kenya recently to provide much needed medical care to underprivileged in urgent need.
I can attest to the fact that Christian returned from Kenya a changed man. A better, more focused man with a keener sense of priorities. His short documentary on the experience tells the tale:

In all honesty, it&#039;s rare that I get an opportunity to sit down with a guy with whom I share so many things in common. As a result, this conversation is long. Really long.  3 hours long.  So I decided to try something new.  For the first time in the brief history of the RRP, I&#039;m splitting this episode up into two parts to be released in the same week. Part 2 will go up later this week on Thursday, May 8.
There are so many fascinating aspects to Christian&#039;s story. I don&#039;t want to spoil it, so you will just have to listen.  
But I will say this: Christian is a solid guy. One of the good guys. The guy you root for and really want to see succeed. Because he shoots straight and walks his talk.</itunes:summary>

But I will say this: Christian is a solid guy. One of the good guys. The guy you root for and really want to see succeed. Because he shoots straight and walks his talk. Shows up when he says he's going to show up and always gives 110% without any expectation of what he might receive in return. A guy with a really strong moral compass and sense of direction. One of those guys whose handshake means more than any signed contract. Old School. Almost as if he comes from an older generation when things like that actually meant something.
My point is this: it is truly rare to find a friend of such solid stock, sturdy moral fiber and unperturbedly strong sense of who he is.  Christian is one of those guys. 
It's my honor to know this man. To be his friend. And to share this conversation with you today.
I sincerely hope you enjoy it.
PS - I just e-mailed Christian to let him know the interview went live. He reminded me of the auspiciousness of this date of publication -- May 5 is the day we both took the first step on our respective EPIC5 journeys.  In all honesty it never occurred to me until he mentioned it.  Crazy how the Universe works sometimes.  But the longer I walk this path the more weird stuff like this just seems to happen.

		<itunes:summary>So many things wrong in the world.
Melting ice caps. Greenhouse gas emissions. Global climate change. GMO Frankenfoods. Depleted soils. Poisoned fish. Rampant childhood obesity. Unsustainable food systems. Horrifying school lunch programs. Unprecedented hurricanes. Insane tsunamis. Constant forest fires. And oh yeah - how about that Texas-sized flotilla of plasticized garbage goo floating out in the Pacific somewhere?
I could go on like this all day.  We all could.  Because in truth it&#039;s easy to identify -- and become despondent (if not just altogether passive and nonplussed) about the state of the planet, the environment, our citizenship and basic humanity when you take an honest look at the havoc we have wrecked upon ourselves.
F-it. I give up. It&#039;s too late.
Then you meet a guy like Kyle Thiermann.  Pro Surfer. Filmmaker. Public Speaker. Environmentalist. Humanitarian. 24 years old.
Suddenly, all that despondency is replaced with hope – optimism for the future of the planet and humanity courtesy of the next generation.
I had never heard of Kyle until a buddy of mine posted an image on Instagram a few months back that promoted Kyle&#039;s latest short film: Pro Surfers vs. GMO&#039;s:

I immediately clicked to watch and was honestly moved. Sure, the film is informative and inspiring. But beyond the content, I was genuinely impressed to find such a young guy so passionate about our food system. Digging deeper I realized this doc was nothing new for this Santa Cruz kid, who was raised by documentary filmmaker parents and has been putting out short films on global health and environmental issues for years via Surfing For Change -- Kyle&#039;s online YouTube series merging surf imagery &amp; lifestyle with current global issues with focus on the power of individuals to create a better world through everyday decisions.
Kyle&#039;s impact has already been substantial. Beyond speaking gigs at universities across the US and features in publications like Outside Magazine and Surfer Magazine, one of Kyle’s first film projects took a look at global bank funding and suggested that people divest from the Bank of Americas of the world and instead invest in local communities  and credit unions. As a direct result of this specific project, Surfing for Change tracked over $110 million of lending power moving out of centralized banks and into local communities. That is serious impact. That is awesome.
If that&#039;s not enough, Kyle gets extra cool points for being the only person I am aware of to ever deliver a TED Talk without a shirt on. That takes cajones.

Be honest: if you were a handsome pro surfer in your early 20&#039;s whose job was to travel the world in search of the tastiest waves, how much time do you think you would spend on trying to make a difference in the world?
Kyle doesn&#039;t have to do what he does. The fact that he chooses of his own volition to invest himself in serving a higher purpose makes his message all the more powerful and resonant.
The millennial generation gets a ton of flack for allegedly being entitled and narcissistic. But Kyle upends this presumption as misplaced, if not altogether false. My experience -- as both a father of two millennial teenage boys and as someone who spends quite a bit of time with people far younger than myself -- is that there are countless young people out there a lot like Kyle. Energetic young people committed to service, improving the planet and making a difference in a way I never saw in myself or my peers when I was of that age.
Let Kyle light the way and be an example of what can be done when passion and faith meet a service mindset and tireless commitment to blaze a new path to better the small world we share.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

		<itunes:summary>The past couple weeks we went deep into nutrition. Now it&#039;s time to take a new direction. To delve into spirit. Creativity. And art. All powerful vehicles for connecting with, unlocking and ultimately expressing the authentic truth of who you are -- the crux of life transformation.
Today we Reimagine Your Truth.
Today we meet IN-Q.
Rapper. Actor. Teacher. Songwriter &amp; internationally revered spoken word artist.
Wait a minute -- what?? A poet? How could spoken word, rap music and this guy possibly have anything to do with the themes of this show?
I can read your mind. I get it. But I ask you to please reserve whatever preconceived ideas or opinions you may have about what&#039;s to come. Because ignorance is contempt prior to investigation. I promise you this -- after this interview you won’t be asking yourself that question.
I first met IN-Q up at a thing called Summit Series -- an organization that began in 2008 with a small group of young entrepreneurs harboring a giant collective dream to change the world. Led by an enterprising young man named Eliot Bisnow (who coincidentally went to my high school), Summit began as an annual four-day events for 1,000 of the world’s leading entrepreneurs, nonprofit leaders, artists, scientists, athletes, and change makers with the intention of driving positive growth and collaboration. 
The events were extremely successful. But Summit has since evolved far beyond a mere producer of TED-like events. Today, it stands tall as a truly unique community of compelling thought leaders who truly are changing the world. About a year ago, the Summit organization took up permanent residence in Eden, Utah -- a quiet hamlet north of Salt Lake nestled in the Wasatch Mountains -- when they purchased a mountain. That’s right: an entire mountain &amp; functioning ski resort called Powder Mountain. Not just any ski resort, &quot;PowMow&quot; is in fact the largest ski mountain in the entire United States.
Ambitious? It&#039;s just the beginning. Summit&#039;s goal is to unite thought leaders and innovators of today and tomorrow by over time growing this now small community into an international epicenter of culture and innovation across all disciplines of art, music, technology, entertainment, science, literature, social entrepreneurism and education.
Eliot invited Julie and I up to Powder Mountain this past winter to speak and simply enjoy a weekend getting to know Summit.  Honestly, I didn’t know what to expect.  I had known the Summit crew for a couple years – in fact Julie taught them a yoga class back in 2008 when it was just a small group of people with big dreams cohabitating in a house in Malibu -- but had yet to experience it for myself.
I have to say it was a transformative experience. I left completely inspired.
One of the most compelling people we met was none other than today&#039;s guest -- IN-Q.
I&#039;ll be upfront. I’m not a poetry guy. I’m not a hip hop guy. These are foreign worlds I know very little to nothing about. On the surface, IN-Q is therefore an unlikely choice for the podcast. But I was so impressed with this man. The moment I met him I knew instantly that I had to have him on the show.
Before each group dinner up at Summit, IN-Q would deliver a poem - a true demonstration of performance art to set the energy of the evening.  More prayer than poem. More inspirational panegyric than prayer even. I simply had never heard anything like it before. It was completely unique.
But it&#039;s not just IN-Q&#039;s mad skills that left my jaw agape.  To be sure, he is oozing with talent and displays total command over his instrument and art. It was his spirit that truly moved me. The way he conducts himself with complete integrity, gratitude and grace; with a rare openness and palpable, unguarded honesty. And the positive resonating message he chooses to convey through his art, writing and voice. IN-Q is a special, special guy.  One of those people who is touched in a very real, tactile way.

To paint the picture a bit, IN-Q is a national poetry slam champion who has shared the stage with Barack Obama, De La Soul, Eminem, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, John Legend and is the first poet to ever share a stage with Cirque de Soleil. He has toured over 70 colleges with his one man show; written songs for Miley Cyrus &amp; Rock Mafia; co-wrote Selena Gomez’s hit song “Love You Like a Love Song”; and has been featured on HBO’s Def Poetry Jam, Versus &amp; Flow, Discovery Channel, Disney Channel. Nickelodeon, EA Sports, ABC, NBC, and A&amp;E.
I won't give away his story – that's what the podcast is for.  But I will say it's a story you won't want to miss. A story and a message that will no doubt make a powerful impression on you. Not only will it move and inspire you, it will help you reframe your perception on your own life.
Let IN-Q help you reimagine YOUR truth.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.
PS - here is one of my favorite IN-Q jams:

		<itunes:summary>Wow! Last week&#039;s guest, T. Colin Campbell, got a huge response. It&#039;s only a week since publication and the episode is well on its way to becoming one of the most popular editions of the RRP to date. Glad you enjoyed it and -- as always -- thanks for tuning in.

Because the Dr. Campbell conversation introduced a large new population to the show, thought I would take a brief moment to clarify what we do here. You may think this is just another podcast focused on running &amp; triathlon. I love those subjects and feature plenty of guests in those arenas. But my focus is broader.

In short, each week I do my best to bring to you the most forward thinking, paradigm busting minds in health, fitness, wellness, diet, nutrition, spirituality, creativity, entrepreneurship and life transformation.

My goal is pure and it is simple. To help motivate and inspire you take your life to the next level. To help you discover, unlock and unleash your best, most authentic self.  BOOM. 

If you have yet to check out last week&#039;s episode, I urge everyone to give that one a listen before checking out today’s show. Even if you think you know all there is to know about T. Colin Campbell, his research, The China Study and the quote unquote alleged “controversy” surrounding the findings of this seminal work, you might be surprised. Dr. Campbell demonstrated tremendous candor. It was an honor to peek behind the curtain at a life well lived in service to the betterment of humankind.

In any event, last week’s guest relates directly to today’s guest. As I mentioned last week, Dr. Campbell was intended as Part 1 of a 2-part series.

What began with Dr. Campbell continues today with Howard Jacobson, Dr. Campbell’s contributing author on his latest book Whole: Rethinking The Science of Nutrition – a book that picks up where The China Study left off by addressing the inherent flaws in our “reductionist” approach to nutrition research and refocusing how we approach and begin to understand nutrition and it&#039;s impact on human physiology from a wholistic point of view – food functionality at the cellular level, working its way up to how it impacts the entire organism.

Great.  But who is Howard Jacobson?

Well, Howard&#039;s background isn’t quite what you would think. He&#039;s not a doctor. He&#039;s not a nutritionist. physiologist or even a scientist. But he is a very smart guy. After getting his B.A. from Princeton, Howard began his career as a school teacher before becoming a successful marketing consultant, running an online marketing agency and writing the book Google AdWords for Dummies (mental note: I should probably read this one).

But how does a &quot;marketing guy&quot; end up hooking up with one of the world&#039;s leading minds in health sciences and ultimately become contributing author on such a seminal work on nutrition?

I had the same question on my mind. 

You’ll have to wait for the interview to hear the answer. But I can tell you it’s a very compelling story – the story of a life journey in search of greater meaning and greater authenticity. A story of faith, serendipity and what can happen when you take the leap into the unknown. Set sail without a paddle. And remain open to the possibilities the universe presents -- the idea that truly anything is possible.

We do it all – starting and ending of course with plant-based nutrition, and the central role it has played in his life, and that of his family. Howard shares his perspective on Dr. Campbell’s work. He picks up where Dr. C left off on the so-called China Study “debunkers&quot;. And we discuss the crux of Whole -- in particular our reductionist proclivities when it comes to nutritional science and how we must reframe how we think about food and how it impacts the body if we want true understanding.

Because our current health system and practices are unsustainable, the public has more power of influence than ever before. Change is finally within our reach.</itunes:summary>

Because our current health system and practices are unsustainable, the public has more power of influence than ever before. Change is finally within our reach. We now know that most heart attacks and strokes, cancers and unnecessary deaths are preventable through nutrition, and we can choose wisely what we put into our mouths every day. This conversation with Howard will help you see Whole as an extraordinary tool to show us how to free our bodies, our minds, and our planet from the economic disparity and biological logic that is making us sicker and poorer than ever before.

As an aside, over the last few years I had met Howie a few times at various events and conferences, but I hadn’t really spent enough time with him to understand the trajectory.  It wasn't until the recent Holistic Holiday at Sea that my family and I had the opportunity to spend quality time with him, his wife and his two amazing children. Together they are an extraordinary family unit doing amazing things. So it is my pleasure and honor to bring this conversation to you today.

Let’s dig in.

PS - we recorded this on a huge boat. Huge. You will hear the gurgling. The anchor rearing up. The engine. Tyler did his best to optimize the audio, but it it is what it is. Not much I can do about that, so let's live with it with a grateful smile on our faces.

		<itunes:summary>This week we hit a huge milestone - 2 MILLION DOWNLOADS! 
Wow. I was blown away when we hit 1 million after about a year since we started this experiment. Then just five months later, we hit the second million. I am beyond words. I love doing the podcast, love it. I do this for you. So it means more than you can imagine that it has found a passionate and loyal audience. With utmost sincerity, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and promise to honor your commitment to the show by striving to always do better and be better.
In honor of the milestone, I thought it appropriate to bring you one of my most compelling and important interviews to date. A conversation with a man I owe my life. A man whose studies, books and tireless advocacy have transformed countless lives across the globe. A man absolutely instrumental in paving a path for my own personal transformation -- a journey that begins and ends with my adoption of a plant-based diet.
T. Colin Campbell
Dr. Campbell may not have invented the whole food plant-based diet, but he is most certainly the regal lion of the movement, pioneering it from fringe acceptance to modern age, widespread mainstream adoption. He is best-known as the author of The China Study, one of the most important, ground-breaking, massively best-selling books ever written on health &amp; nutrition. More recently, Dr. Campbell published an important follow up, Whole: Rethinking The Science of Nutrition. But even if you have not read either of these books, there is a solid chance you saw him and his work profiled in the incredibly powerful documentary Forks Over Knives.
The simple truth is that how we are beginning to understand the ways in which food and nutrition impact the underlying causes of so many Western diseases that unnecessarily plague developed cultures -- and the means to prevent and reverse them -- is due in large part to the tireless scientific research to which Dr. Campbell has devoted his life. He is, quite simply put, an absolute paradigm-busting legend of the modern movement for long-term wellness, disease prevention &amp; reversal, sustainable ecosystems, animal welfare, and agricultural reform.
For the uninitiated, T. Colin Campbell is a Cornell and MIT trained Ph.D. in nutrition, biochemistry and microbiology and current professor emeritus at Cornell specializing in both nutrition &amp; toxicology – specifically the effects of nutrition on long-term health and even more particularly the role nutrition plays in the causation of certain types of cancer. In addition to the two books mentioned above, he is the author of over 300 peer reviewed research papers on a variety of subjects related to the above.
Maybe you&#039;re new to all this -- I don&#039;t get all the fuss.  What exactly is The China Study?
In a nutshell, it was a gigantic 20-year epidemiological study – described by The New York Times as &quot;the Grand Prix of epidemiology&quot; – conducted by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, Cornell and Oxford that looked at mortality rates from cancer and other chronic diseases from 1973–75 in 65 counties in China; the data was correlated with dietary surveys and blood work from 100 people in each county. 
Why China? And why those specific counties? These communities were carefully selected primarily because they had genetically similar populations that tended, over many generations, to live and eat in the same way in the same place.
What were the findings? The study concluded that counties with a high consumption of animal-based foods were more likely to have had higher death rates from &quot;Western&quot; diseases while the opposite was true for counties that ate more plant foods.
In essence, The China Study examined the relationship between the consumption of animal products (including dairy) and chronic illnesses such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancers of the breast, prostate and bowel, concluding that people who eat a whole-food, plant-based/vegan diet—avoiding all animal products,</itunes:summary>

This week we hit a huge milestone - 2 MILLION DOWNLOADS! 
Wow. I was blown away when we hit 1 million after about a year since we started this experiment. Then just five months later, we hit the second million. I am beyond words. I love doing the podcast, love it. I do this for you. So it means more than you can imagine that it has found a passionate and loyal audience. With utmost sincerity, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and promise to honor your commitment to the show by striving to always do better and be better.
In honor of the milestone, I thought it appropriate to bring you one of my most compelling and important interviews to date. A conversation with a man I owe my life. A man whose studies, books and tireless advocacy have transformed countless lives across the globe. A man absolutely instrumental in paving a path for my own personal transformation -- a journey that begins and ends with my adoption of a plant-based diet.
T. Colin Campbell
Dr. Campbell may not have invented the whole food plant-based diet, but he is most certainly the regal lion of the movement, pioneering it from fringe acceptance to modern age, widespread mainstream adoption. He is best-known as the author of The China Study, one of the most important, ground-breaking, massively best-selling books ever written on health &amp; nutrition. More recently, Dr. Campbell published an important follow up, Whole: Rethinking The Science of Nutrition. But even if you have not read either of these books, there is a solid chance you saw him and his work profiled in the incredibly powerful documentary Forks Over Knives.
The simple truth is that how we are beginning to understand the ways in which food and nutrition impact the underlying causes of so many Western diseases that unnecessarily plague developed cultures -- and the means to prevent and reverse them -- is due in large part to the tireless scientific research to which Dr. Campbell has devoted his life. He is, quite simply put, an absolute paradigm-busting legend of the modern movement for long-term wellness, disease prevention &amp; reversal, sustainable ecosystems, animal welfare, and agricultural reform.

In addition to the two books mentioned above, he is the author of over 300 peer reviewed research papers on a variety of subjects related to the above.
Maybe you're new to all this -- I don't get all the fuss.  What exactly is The China Study?
In a nutshell, it was a gigantic 20-year epidemiological study – described by The New York Times as "the Grand Prix of epidemiology" – conducted by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, Cornell and Oxford that looked at mortality rates from cancer and other chronic diseases from 1973–75 in 65 counties in China; the data was correlated with dietary surveys and blood work from 100 people in each county. 
Why China? And why those specific counties? These communities were carefully selected primarily because they had genetically similar populations that tended, over many generations, to live and eat in the same way in the same place.
What were the findings? The study concluded that counties with a high consumption of animal-based foods were more likely to have had higher death rates from "Western" diseases while the opposite was true for counties that ate more plant foods.
In essence, The China Study examined the relationship between the consumption of animal products (including dairy) and chronic illnesses such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancers of the breast, prostate and bowel, concluding that people who eat a whole-food, plant-based/vegan diet—avoiding all animal products, including beef, pork, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese and milk, and reducing their intake of processed foods and refined carbohydrates -- will escape, reduce or even reverse the development of numerous diseases.
Much to Dr. Campbell's surprise, the book barely moved the needle when it was first published. In fact, it basically landed with a thud. But slowly, things started to take off when certain highly influential people began to discover the book, implement it's advice, and experience dramatic positive results in their health and waistline.
Even President Bill Clinton became a vocal supporter. After years of living with heart disease, in 2010 he undertook the diet, and within a short period dropped 24 pounds, returning him to his college weight. You might have seen my buddy Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, interview Clinton for Dr. Gupta’s documentary The Last Heart Attack that aired on CNN in August 2011.  In that documentary, Dr Gupta made evident the power of plants -- and the impact of Dr. Campbell's dietary guidelines -- on not only slimming the gut, but in preventing and even reversing heart disease. A protocol that has seen similar results in the prevention and reversal of obesity, diabetes and certain forms of cancer -- 4 diseases that currently gobble up 75% of America's total health care costs.
Pretty awesome stuff.
But The China Study is not without its critics and controversy. In the wake of the massive success of his book and Forks Over Knives, his findings have been challenged -- correlation does not equal causation! And suddenly -- for reasons that essentially elude me -- it has become quite vogue to offhandedly and rather thoughtlessly quip: Didn’t you hear the news? The China Study was debunked!
But has The China Study really been debunked? What is this truly all about?
Ask yourself this question: Who is threatened by attempting to undermine the integrity of Dr. Campbell’s game changing research?  And who stands to gain?
We get in to all of this and so much more in today’s conversation.  
Dr. Campbell does not often sit for such long-winded interviews, so it was quite an honor and privilege to grab an hour of his time during the recent Holistic Holiday at Sea.  I had met him on several occasions over the last few years, but this was my first opportunity really getting to know the person behind the book, the research, and the movement. And I learned a lot.
I am very proud of this interview and hope that it will inspire and motivate you to think about your health, your diet and your lifestyle in new and different ways -- ways that could have a profound impact on your future well-being. And even if you are well versed with Dr. Campbell and his work, I promise you will learn things about him, his life and research that you did not previously know.
A final note: this interview is intended as Part 1 of a 2 part series.  Next week, I will be bringing you Howard Jacobson, Ph.D. -- Dr. Campbell’s contributing author on Whole – who shares his own compelling story and fills in the gaps on some of the issues touched upon during today's conversation. So if you enjoy today’s show you will definitely want to tune in next week as well.
In any event, I truly hope today's conversation educates and inspires you to take your nutrition, health and fitness to the next level. All as a means to help you unlock and unleash your best, most authentic self.
Thanks for tuning in.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>I had to put my dog down the other day. I want to tell you about it. It might seem unrelated to introducing today&#039;s podcast guest, but it&#039;s not. So bear with me.
Bodhi was a great dog. Indeed, a prince. But over the last several months, cancer took the upper hand. Tumors filled his left lung until it shut down, diseased cells metastasizing at a horrible pace until the poor guy could barely lift his head, let alone stand up. Stalwart, Bodhi hid his pain well. But it was there; unmistakable and unrelenting. I felt helpless.  
It’s the humane thing to do. You did the right thing.
The words of the kind veterinarian who handled the Kevorkian end of this pyrrhic victory to cease my dog&#039;s suffering.
I gently cradled his head and locked my eyes with his as the needle sank deep beneath his fur. What followed were my tears as the fragile life force dwindled from his limp body until his beautiful soul had vanished altogether. All the while, my only thought: this doesn&#039;t feel like the right thing. In fact, it all feels terribly, horribly wrong.
Bodhi is gone.
It happens. The heartache that accompanies the short lifespan of man&#039;s best friend is the very nature of this relationship. I signed up for it and I accept it. In truth, our golden retriever had a great 12 years with our family - a time we will always cherish and for which I am forever grateful. But that doesn’t mean it doesn&#039;t hurt.  In truth, it sucks.
Bodhi is short for Bodhisattva – the ancient Sanskrit word for enlightened being. One who is motivated by great compassion. A more apt name for this dog does not, could not, exist.

I guess the point is, as incredibly trite as this may sound – and it is nothing if not trite – life is short. Life is precious. Life is fleeting. And if one lives life motivated by fear and locked into habits that lead to regression, safety and misery, the precipitous end to that life will be nothing if not a lament to regret and remorse --for the authentic life of the higher self left unlived.
We live in our flawed memories of the past. And are experts at projecting outcomes and fantasies onto a future that simply does not (and unlikely will ever) exist. What we rarely do is live in the now. Present in the moment. Experiencing gratitude for the immediacy of what is happening right in front of our very eyes on a second-to-second basis.
Why is this so hard for us humans?
The answer to this question brings me to today&#039;s guest.
Timothy Olson.
A man who understands and appreciates what it means to fully embrace the present. To live his life in the throes of gratitude. Yes, he runs. Faster, further and wider than most anyone else on Earth. But it&#039;s this aforementioned spiritual perspective and journey that defines what this guy -- at his core -- is truly all about.
For the uninitiated, Timothy is an insanely accomplished world reknown ultrarunner. Aside from Kílian Jornet (who we can almost write off as otherworldly), you could make the argument that Timothy is one of the greatest -- if not the greatest -- ultrarunners on the planet right now.
After pulling himself out of a drug-fueled descent into the dark abyss -- a journey that left him lost in life, depressed, desperate, incarcerated and on probation -- Timothy found not just solace but an entirely new life through running. A path that unfolded a fundamental personal spirituality emanating from hours alone exploring nature on two feet. A journey that led to discovering the transformative power of gratitude. To touching and unlocking a deeper, more meaningful part of himself.  And to eclipsing the void beyond the limits of his preconceived physical, mental and emotional capabilities.
Despite an ultra-running career that began just 5 years ago in 2009, it didn&#039;t take long before he was racking up big wins in big-time races. But everything blew wide open in 2012 when Timothy didn&#039;t just cross the finish line first at the Western States 100 trail race -- one of the most prestigious 100-mile ul</itunes:summary>

Despite an ultra-running career that began just 5 years ago in 2009, it didn't take long before he was racking up big wins in big-time races. But everything blew wide open in 2012 when Timothy didn't just cross the finish line first at the Western States 100 trail race -- one of the most prestigious 100-mile ultra-running races on the planet -- he destroyed the field, crushing the previous course record by a full 20 minutes.  Imagine running 100 miles on steep elevation trails in thin high altitude air in just 14 hours and 46 minutes.
No one hit wonder, Timothy returned to the WS 100 in 2013 and won it again decisively. 
This July, Timothy's eyes are firmly set on the Hardrock 100 -- a 100-mile trail run that entails 34,000 feet of climbing, 68,000 feet of total elevation change at an average elevation of 11,000 feet.  This is what we call hardcore.
To be sure, what Timothy has accomplished and will no doubt continue to accomplish on the trail is nothing short of remarkable, particularly in light of where he was in life just a few short years ago. But quite honestly, I am less interested in his victories and athleticism than I am in what got him there. I am convinced that the essential ingredient in Timothy's success equation is his unique perspective on life. His soul surfer approach to sport. 
Timothy is a guy who knows real pain.  Someone who has lived in the pitch black prison with no means for escape. Somehow, and against all odds, he found the keys to freedom and emerged on the other side not just intact, but whole. A man driven to continuously find, explore and embrace the love and the light in what he’s doing, a living ambassador of his favorite social media hashtag: #neverstopexploring.
Living close to nature. Minimally and with priorities straight. At peace. On the trail. As a husband. A dad. A man.  A complete, authentic, actualized man currently in the full force of his talent and power. A man questing the fringes of his own personal enlightenment, motivated by great compassion.
One bodhisattva in my life moves on.  Another enters.  And I am grateful for both.
This is the cycle and what makes life beautiful. So breathe it in. Appreciate it with all of who you are. Embrace the gratitude. Find the moment. Take the risk. Leap into the void. And make it everything. In this you will find the beauty of who you are.
I told you I'd bring it around.
I hope you enjoy the conversation.
Peace + Plants,

		<itunes:summary>A few weeks back I had the pleasure of being a keynote speaker &amp; instructor on the Holistic Holiday at Sea -- 1500 people cohabiting for 7 days on a Caribbean cruise ship for the specific purpose of learning more about health. How to eat better. And live more fully.
When I agreed to participate, I had no idea the magnitude of this event. The incredible scale of this thing. I’m not a cruise ship kind of guy.  Quite honestly, I prefer a shack on a deserted beach to a floating mall housing 2200. 
I was leery.
In the aftermath, I can&#039;t say the experience converted me to cruising as a lifestyle. But I will say it ended up being an extraordinary experience -- an event I highly recommend to those out there looking for something different to kick things into a new gear. I got to meet and spend time with some of the leading minds in the plant-based wellness Universe. Some I already knew, like legends T. Colin Campbell, author of The China Study and Whole (podcast coming soon!), PCRM founder Neal Barnard, Chef AJ (RRP Episode 56), bodybuilder Robert Cheeke, fitness impresario Koya Webb and many others.
But what made the experience so memorable was meeting and spending time with people I had never before met. Presenters like today&#039;s guest of course, but mostly just normal people interested in learning more about getting better -- and sharing their intimate stories. And so – despite my preconceived notions of what this experience would hold – I left rather inspired.  By the lives and experiences and struggles and obstacles people face. And the success stories of overcoming everything from obesity to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, food addictions and more to live happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives.
Leeriness transformed. A win-win.
Today’s guest is one of the guys I met on the cruise.  I guy who I’ve admired from afar for some time, but had yet to meet.
Dr. Michael Klaper.
A rare bird this one.  A physician who actually really cares about the patient.  Before you get angry and defensive about docs -- I’m not saying that doctors don’t care about their patients.  I am saying that this insane institutionalized system of medicine we have created basically forces well intentioned docs from getting too invested in their patients.  They just can’t.  Economics prevents this kind of time and emotional investment.
Well, Dr. Klaper is a guy who got fed up with that system – like Peter Finch’s epic famous lament in Paddy Chayefsky’s Network -- I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore! – and started treating patients the way he felt they should be treated.  It wasn’t exactly the best business plan – there was the time he went broke trying to make it work.  It’s that hard to do. But his story, his message. and how he now makes it all work, is educational.  And inspirational.

“Health comes from healthy living.”

As an acute care physician for many years practicing in many locales (Canada, New Zealand, Hawaii and now Northern California), Dr. K began to realize that many of the diseases his patients brought to his office – clogged arteries (atherosclerosis), high blood pressure (hypertension), obesity, adult onset diabetes, and even some forms of arthritis, asthma, and other significant illnesses – were made worse, or actually caused, by the high-fat, high sugar, overly processed Standard American Diet (S.A.D.).
Not dissimilar to Dr. Frank Lipman (RRP Episode 72), Dr. Klaper came to understand how crucial proper nutrition and a balanced lifestyle are essential for health and, in many cases, make the difference between healing an illness, preventing an illness and even reversing an illness versus merely treating the symptoms – or masking them with drugs that have no impact on dealing with the illness’ cause. 
So he began to treat his patients accordingly – with astounding results.
In addition to being on staff physician at TrueNorth Health Center in Santa Rosa,</itunes:summary>

When I agreed to participate, I had no idea the magnitude of this event. The incredible scale of this thing. I’m not a cruise ship kind of guy.  Quite honestly, I prefer a shack on a deserted beach to a floating mall housing 2200. 
I was leery.
In the aftermath, I can't say the experience converted me to cruising as a lifestyle. But I will say it ended up being an extraordinary experience -- an event I highly recommend to those out there looking for something different to kick things into a new gear. I got to meet and spend time with some of the leading minds in the plant-based wellness Universe. Some I already knew, like legends T. Colin Campbell, author of The China Study and Whole (podcast coming soon!), PCRM founder Neal Barnard, Chef AJ (RRP Episode 56), bodybuilder Robert Cheeke, fitness impresario Koya Webb and many others.
But what made the experience so memorable was meeting and spending time with people I had never before met. Presenters like today's guest of course, but mostly just normal people interested in learning more about getting better -- and sharing their intimate stories. And so – despite my preconceived notions of what this experience would hold – I left rather inspired.  By the lives and experiences and struggles and obstacles people face. And the success stories of overcoming everything from obesity to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, food addictions and more to live happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives.
Leeriness transformed. A win-win.
Today’s guest is one of the guys I met on the cruise.  I guy who I’ve admired from afar for some time, but had yet to meet.
Dr. Michael Klaper.
A rare bird this one.  A physician who actually really cares about the patient.  Before you get angry and defensive about docs -- I’m not saying that doctors don’t care about their patients.  I am saying that this insane institutionalized system of medicine we have created basically forces well intentioned docs from getting too invested in their patients.  They just can’t.  Economics prevents this kind of time and emotional investment.
Well, Dr. Klaper is a guy who got fed up with that system – like Peter Finch’s epic famous lament in Paddy Chayefsky’s Network -- I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore! – and started treating patients the way he felt they should be treated.  It wasn’t exactly the best business plan – there was the time he went broke trying to make it work.  It’s that hard to do. But his story, his message. and how he now makes it all work, is educational.  And inspirational.

“Health comes from healthy living.”

As an acute care physician for many years practicing in many locales (Canada, New Zealand, Hawaii and now Northern California), Dr. K began to realize that many of the diseases his patients brought to his office – clogged arteries (atherosclerosis), high blood pressure (hypertension), obesity, adult onset diabetes, and even some forms of arthritis, asthma, and other significant illnesses – were made worse, or actually caused, by the high-fat, high sugar, overly processed Standard American Diet (S.A.D.).
Not dissimilar to Dr. Frank Lipman (RRP Episode 72), Dr. Klaper came to understand how crucial proper nutrition and a balanced lifestyle are essential for health and, in many cases, make the difference between healing an illness, preventing an illness and even reversing an illness versus merely treating the symptoms – or masking them with drugs that have no impact on dealing with the illness’ cause. 
So he began to treat his patients accordingly – with astounding results.
In addition to being on staff physician at TrueNorth Health Center in Santa Rosa, California -- a nutritionally-based medical clinic specializing in therapeutic fasting and health improvement through a whole-foods, plant-based diet -- Dr. Klaper is also a pilot.  A teacher. An author. And generally a great, very kind and giving, affable guy.  A throwback to the friendly family docs of a byegone era.  The trusty guy who would make house calls in the middle of the night (which he did). Sit and have tea with your mom while you lied in your bed upstairs with a thermometer in your mouth.
All I can say is that I hope I look as good and have as much energy as he does when I'm his age.
A few weeks back he sat down with me -- in his little cabin on this huge boat smack in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle -- to tell us all about his journey.
Let's see if we make it out alive....
Peace + Plants,

	<itunes:subtitle>I&#039;m told that Osher Gunsberg is quite the thing Down Under. Under former stage name Andrew G he lit up Australian airwaves as host of the popular Channel V -- the Oz version of MTV&#039;s TRL -- and went on to host Australian Idol,</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>I&#039;m told that Osher Gunsberg is quite the thing Down Under. Under former stage name Andrew G he lit up Australian airwaves as host of the popular Channel V -- the Oz version of MTV&#039;s TRL -- and went on to host Australian Idol, Live to Dance here in US with Paula Abdul, and more recently was the guy giving out roses back in his homeland on The Bachelor.
That stuff is cool I suppose. Good on ya mate. But that&#039;s not how I know Osher. In fact, I&#039;ve never seen him once on television and didn&#039;t even know about any of that stuff until we had hung out several times. Moreover, it really has nothing to do with why I wanted to sit down and bend his ear.
I know Osher just as a good friend. We met about a year ago and he has become one of my closer friends over this period of time.  I guy I can call up, and with whom I can talk life things through -- because he has endured and overcome similar challenges and always has a wise word or two that helps me navigate whatever I happen to be going through. A guy who knows how to really appreciate a good long trail run. And a guy I can share stories with on a cycling excursion in my local Santa Monica Mountains.
Of course you like this guy – he’s the spitting image of you! What is this, some kind of weird self-love thing?
Yeah, yeah. If you see the photo that accompanies this episode it is kind of weird. Like my twin brother or something – the resemblance in that image is admittedly a bit comical. Same glasses, stubble, t-shirt, hair, etc. Yeah that’s funny. I like to joke that he is my doppelgänger. In truth we actually don’t look all that much alike in person – it&#039;s just how that particular photo came out. Trust me, Osher is much more handsome and charming than me, as you will soon see.
But I guess there is some truth to the dopplegänger idea below the surface. Like me, Osher is a plant-based guy. Distance runner. Recent cycling convert (I&#039;m cajoling him into signing up for his first triathlon). Not to mention a guy who has weathered divorce (although not sure you can characterize what I went through back in &#039;96 as really much of a &quot;marriage&quot; or a &quot;divorce&quot; - if you read my book, you&#039;ll get my meaning).
If you are a long time listener to the show then you&#039;ll remember I had Osher on back in May (Episode 30) to interview me as a fun turning of the tables to correspond with the paperback release of Finding Ultra. Because he is such a broadcasting pro at all of this he was the logical choice -- and it was a ton of fun.
But the more I got to know him, the more I realized he has a compelling story in his own right that I really wanted to help tell. Like some of our previous guests, a guy who has struggled with many relatable things in life we can connect with emotionally. A chubby kid and junk food addict determined to find a way out of his situation, he found success and improved self-esteem by way of a plant-based diet and learning how to run. A journey that now finds him enjoying marathons and cycling.
More than that, we have a really interesting discussion about divorce – and because of the way our society is configured, how it can be so difficult for men in particular to to heal from this &quot;adventure&quot; in a healthy way. A way he found through a  core set of spiritual principles to ground, orient and guide his emotional and mental and physical energy and overall life trajectory. 
So if you are going through some of the same things in your life, I think you will find the discussion really really interesting. 
Plus, Osher is just a great bloke. And the boy is a total professional when it comes to interesting conversation – which makes me look good and my job easy. So there&#039;s that.
Joking inside, I think you will our time compelling – it will make you think about certain things and leave you inspired.  At least that’s how I felt. If you dig the talk, then you will dig his podcast: The Osher Günsberg Podcast - check it out!
Enjoy the listen. Enjoy your week.

		<itunes:summary>I love people who ask questions other people aren&#039;t asking. See trends others don&#039;t see. Have the courage to try a new approach. Risk the illusion of security. Think differently. Jump into the abyss with nothing but faith and their own resolve in search of answers. And refuse to wait for permission to simply do.
In a certain sense, this dictate can be boiled down to a singular principle -- people who Choose Themselves.
And this is what today&#039;s guest is all about.
Enter James Altucher.
Where to even begin with this multi-talented hyphenate. Hedge fund manager, investor &amp; serial entrepreneur, James has founded or co-founded over 20 companies; chess master; inspirational public speaker, radio, television and successful podcast host (his show debuted at #1 on all of iTunes a few months back); bestselling author with 11 books to his name, both self-published and with the biggest publishing houses; husband, and father.
I first stumbled upon the world of James Altucher about a year ago through his prolific, always humorous discernments on his The Altucher Confidential Blog and have counted myself a rabid fan ever since.
What keeps me coming back isn&#039;t just his keen perceptions and invaluable insights, but the honesty, authenticity and total transparency as a vehicle to deliver his perceptions. A self-deprecating style that astutely mines his many fears and failures with a profound degree of relatability that threads a fabric of deep emotional connection with his readership. An expert in navigating rejection and colossal failure with as much enthusiasm and authority as his lays out -- brick-by-brick -- the many principles he has honed and freely shares to achieve greater health, perspective, life satisfaction and prosperity.
We live in precarious times. A fear-based, quickly changing world pulling the thinly veiled curtain on the illusion of security. To crib a few ideas from James, markets have crashed. The traditional idea of jobs are disappearing. Everything we thought was “safe,” no longer is: College. Employment. Retirement. Government. In every part of society, the middlemen are being pushed out of the picture. No longer is someone coming to hire you, to invest in your company, to sign you, to pick you. More than ever, it falls on the individual to create a sustainable future.
Scary stuff.
We can look at this as a crisis.  Or we can change perspective and see it as a moment of great opportunity. As always, destruction begets renewal.  The truth is that we live in an amazing, unprecedented time of opportunity. A time of fantastical technology that in many ways has simply eradicated the seat once occupied by what we call the gatekeepers. With the advent of mind-blowing software and social media, new tools and economic forces are emerging that make it more possible than ever for individuals to create, thrive and change the world without “help” from the finicky sometimes not so permissive hand traditionally relied upon to feed us. 
This is the idea behind what James would call the Choose Yourself era.  It&#039;s also the title of his most recent book, a roadmap primer on transcending the decaying the master/servant paradigm of our economic system of employment and a call to action on how to configure a more meaningful life liberated from the so-called gatekeepers. 
With a keen wit and finely honed insight, James is a guy who sees, understands and can translate life principles in a way that will both challenge and humor you.
I encourage all of you to read his book and the many articles on his blog, then experiment by incorporating his tools into your life.
So there you go.
I hope you enjoy today&#039;s conversation.  I certainly did.  Let me know what you think in the comments below.

		<itunes:summary>Jonathan Fields is a super popular guy. There is a good reason for that, which I&#039;m going to get into in a minute.
Before I do, I wanted to check in with you in a bit about what we do over here at the RRP. I have the feeling that Jonathan&#039;s appeal will attract some cool new people to the audience (welcome!), so I wanted to take a quick moment to recap the mission.
Yes, I am a plant-based endurance athlete. And yes, I do have many plant-based enthusiasts on this show. But this is hardly a narrowly defined &quot;fitness&quot; or &quot;vegan&quot; themed podcast. It&#039;s far more about inspiration. I cast a very broad net. When thinking about guests, my litmus test is finding fascinating people and personalities that span a variety of disciplines. People who push boundaries. Live extraordinary lives. Think different. Blaze their own path.  Question the status quo. And live large and on their own terms – in service not just to themselves, but in devotion to others, catalyzing life changing improvement in the quality of people&#039;s lives, and overall simply raising the bar on what is possible.
I deliver these conversations with the sole intention of providing you with a stocked tool-box of education, information, motivation and inspiration to help you take the quality of your life to the next level. The goal? To assist in helping you unlock and unleash your best most authentic self. That&#039;s it. Pure and simple.
Last week I published an article entitled, &quot;Why You Should Stop Lifehacking and Invest in the Journey&quot; (also up on Medium). I wrote it because I have been thinking a lot lately about self-improvement.  More specifically our shortcutting, lifehacking, biohacking obsessed culture. This meme-fueled drive to circumvent process and expedite results. In and of itself fine. I’m all about efficiencies. But there is something that really bothers me about this trend because on a certain some level it downgrades the inherent value of process. Disrespect for the journey. And the blood, sweat, tears and joy from simply showing up and suiting up for the full commitment.
To me, the journey is everything. That is where the value lies. It’s a sentiment that was echoed in last weeks podcast episode with Casey Neistat – a guy who overcame tremendous obstacles with nothing but faith, will, belief and total commitment to process. 
And it&#039;s an ethos that really captures what today’s guest is all about. All in all, a guy who understands the long-term value of the journey over the temporary thrill of the #lifehack.
Jonathan Fields. Dad. Husband,  serial-entrepreneur, award-winning, bestselling author, speaker, A-list blogger, web-show host, and mindful innovation strategist who has been profiled in pretty much every prestigious publication there is, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, FastCompany, and Forbes. A guy I have been following with great enthusiasm to my tremendous benefit for years.
On a personal level, Jonathan is guy I can deeply relate to – a guy (like me) who decided to leave the gilded protective hallways of the corporate law firm existence and risk everything in search of a life path of greater meaning for himself and others.  Well Jonathan found it -- in spades.  His mission? To humanize and empower the process of creation. To help people and organizations conceive and build better, more conscious businesses, art, and lives in less time, with more joy and less effort.
What gives Jonathan&#039;s particular brand of entrepreneurship such resonance with me personally is his inherent focus on process over results. Emphasis on the journey over the destination. An understanding that authenticity is everything. And that mindfulness lays forth the path. This is reflected in everything he does, from his writing and public speaking to his online educational courses and most importantly his life.

I had the honor of being interviewed by Jonathan last year for an episode of his Good Life Project web series -- an exploration of lives well-lived featuring conversations with acclaimed entrepreneurs, artists and authors you should most definitely check out -- and I am so pleased that he reciprocated, taking the time to sit down with me in New York a few weeks back.
I sincerely hope you enjoy this conversation with one of the most considerate and empowering people I have the good fortune to know.

Casey Neistat



 
Simple yet profound words from this week&#039;s guest, a man in full embrace of the ethos of living an impactful, creative, authentic life in overdrive.

Uncompromising. Unapologetic. Filmmaker, photographer, builder, father, humanitarian, athlete. But most of all, an artist leveraging his boundless creative energy to tell personal stories that inspire all of us to find the adventure in life. To invest in experience. To be bold. And to do more -- both for yourself and for others.

I first became aware of Casey around 2010 when his show &quot;The Neistat Brothers&quot; aired on HBO and was immediately captivated by Casey&#039;s DIY sensibility. His fearlessness. His acute ability to find the wonder in the seemingly banal. And his refusal to await permission from the gatekeepers to create. I&#039;ve been a fan ever since, eagerly anticipating each new upload to his wildly popular YouTube channel -- 82 movies he refuses to monetize; a network that enjoys a quarter of a million rabid subscribers; and dozens of viral sensations with 50+ million views.

At this point, many of you have likely seen his remarkable &quot;Make It Count&quot;. If you somehow missed it, please watch it now for context before listening to the episode (I&#039;ve watched it at least 20 times and never get tired of it). Hired by Nike to create an advertisement to promote the Fuel Band, Casey audaciously ignored the agreed upon commercial treatment and instead brashly spent the entire budget traveling the world, all the while documenting his incredible adventure until the money just flat ran out. 34,000 miles, three continents, 13 countries, 16 cities and 10 million views later, the rest is history.

This past December, Casey raised the bar. Contacted by 20th Century Fox to create a movie to help promote &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;, Casey agreed, with one caveat: permission to donate the entire commercial budget to typhoon victims in the Philippines. Tying creative expression to service,  &quot;What Would You Do with $25,000?&quot; became an instant viral hit, trending on Twitter to over 3 million views.

Then just one day after we sat down for this conversation, Casey headed out in a blizzard to &quot;Snowboard NYC&quot; -- a sponsor-less lark he posted within 24 hours of shooting that clocked 5 million views in it&#039;s first five days.

In the words of Wired Magazine, &quot;Casey Neistat’s bite-size Internet movies have so much viral potential they make influenza jealous.&quot; But what is it that makes Casey and his work so irresistible?  Sure, the movies are fun.  Irreverant.  Visually captivating with great music and personal storylines that always star Casey himself as the ever-appealing protagonist.

But in my opinion, what makes Casey stand out, what gives his work permanent residence in my consciousness, is his devotion to authenticity -- an axiom of conviction that infuses every single frame of every single work he produces -- and the predominant over-arching theme of this podcast.

It was a treat to drop in on Casey&#039;s Lower Manhattan studio -- &quot;one of the most compulsively organized, ridiculously customized, and mind-bogglingly gear-saturated spaces on Planet Awesome&quot; -- and I am super pumped to bring you this powerful conversation with a life premised upon creative passion, a tireless work ethic, a conviction to constantly invest in experience above everything, and an oftentimes logic-defying faith in the journey.

Something I like to call the warrior path.

Listen with ears open. Objectively ponder the limitless possibilities presented in your own life. Then -- to echo the words permanently inked on Casey&#039;s forearm -- DO MORE.

The awesome black &amp; white photo of Casey (below and in the above YouTube clip) is courtesy of the incredibly talented Manfredi Gioacchini.  Check out his website and follow him on Instagram!

		<itunes:summary>We need more doctors in the world like Dr. Frank Lipman.
Western medicine is astounding when it comes to treating acute, isolated conditions -- a catastrophic injury, an arterial blockage or a serious infection, for example.  But how does it fare when it comes to preventing disease, particularly chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, obesity and countless other conditions sweeping the globe like a modern day plague? Well, not so well. On this I think we can all agree.
On that note, when was the last time your doctor focused his inquiry on things like increasing energy levels and general vitality, elevating mood, sustaining optimal body weight, or enhancing mental acuity and focus?  Not recently I would imagine, if ever.  He or she might advise you to reduce the stress in your life, &quot;eat better&quot; and/or &quot;start taking care of yourself&quot; -- but these proclamations are rarely combined with an actual specific protocol to implement. And that, my friends is a shame.
Dr. Lipman is working to break this paradigm.  Early in his medical career, he began to see that the polarization between western modalities and other healing philosophies merely negated positive attributes of both. He began to see that true healing lay in a blend between the two. He now practices his unique method of what he calls “Good Medicine”, which merges the best of the west with many traditions more eastern or alternative in origin -- a holistic form of medicine that is truly unique and integrative in its approach to patients.  It&#039;s for this reason he has become the go-to, in-demand doctor for the celebrated -- people like Donna Karan, Kevin Bacon, Gwenyth Paltrow, Peter Sarsgaard &amp; Maggie Gyllenhaal.
If pharmaceuticals are truly in order to rectify an acute medical issue, he is happy to prescribe. But disease management isn&#039;t what gets him out of bed every morning excited about life. Instead, it&#039;s taking the time to evaluate each patient as a complex web of interdependent systems, with a keen lens focused on disease prevention.  The idea is to optimize the quality of his patients&#039; lives through implementing techniques such as acupuncture; Chinese, herbal &amp; functional medicine; nutrition; biofeedback; meditation; and yoga.  
When was the last time your doctor prescribed you to go to yoga? It&#039;s never happened to me, and I live in LA.  
In short, Dr. Lipman&#039;s ultimate goal for all his patients is simple: sustained, long-term, optimal wellness.  
Sustained, long-term, optimal wellness.
If you know me, then you know I&#039;m all about this subject.  So it was an honor and a treat to sit down with Dr. Lipman in his office at Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in the Flatiron District of Manhattan -- with its soothing meditation retreat / yoga studio vibe -- where he generously offered up his perspective on medicine &amp; the medical profession, nutrition &amp; food allergies, and the types of things we can and should all focus on more intently if we want to maximize our &quot;wellness&quot; in the truest sense of this all-too often over-hyped word.
I hope you enjoy the enlightening conversation.  Leave a comment below and let me know what you think.  And don&#039;t forget to give Tyler -- my trusty podcast producer and stepson -- a nice shoutout for all his hard work not just putting today&#039;s show together, but for all his amazing original music compositions that accompany the interview. Thanks Ty!

He began to see that true healing lay in a blend between the two. He now practices his unique method of what he calls “Good Medicine”, which merges the best of the west with many traditions more eastern or alternative in origin -- a holistic form of medicine that is truly unique and integrative in its approach to patients.  It's for this reason he has become the go-to, in-demand doctor for the celebrated -- people like Donna Karan, Kevin Bacon, Gwenyth Paltrow, Peter Sarsgaard &amp; Maggie Gyllenhaal.
If pharmaceuticals are truly in order to rectify an acute medical issue, he is happy to prescribe. But disease management isn't what gets him out of bed every morning excited about life. Instead, it's taking the time to evaluate each patient as a complex web of interdependent systems, with a keen lens focused on disease prevention.  The idea is to optimize the quality of his patients' lives through implementing techniques such as acupuncture; Chinese, herbal &amp; functional medicine; nutrition; biofeedback; meditation; and yoga.  
When was the last time your doctor prescribed you to go to yoga? It's never happened to me, and I live in LA.  
In short, Dr. Lipman's ultimate goal for all his patients is simple: sustained, long-term, optimal wellness.  
Sustained, long-term, optimal wellness.
If you know me, then you know I'm all about this subject.  So it was an honor and a treat to sit down with Dr. Lipman in his office at Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in the Flatiron District of Manhattan -- with its soothing meditation retreat / yoga studio vibe -- where he generously offered up his perspective on medicine &amp; the medical profession, nutrition &amp; food allergies, and the types of things we can and should all focus on more intently if we want to maximize our "wellness" in the truest sense of this all-too often over-hyped word.
I hope you enjoy the enlightening conversation.  Leave a comment below and let me know what you think.  And don't forget to give Tyler -- my trusty podcast producer and stepson -- a nice shoutout for all his hard work not just putting today's show together, but for all his amazing original music compositions that accompany the interview. Thanks Ty!

		<itunes:summary>Straight up, this conversation encapsulates every aspiration I ever had for the show when I embarked upon this podcast journey a little over a year ago: inspiration, in the form of a relatable everyman guest sharing his personal story openly and honestly with absolute humility and a vulnerability that is rare in today&#039;s panoply of admirable role models.
We get emotional. We get real. We get authentic.  There&#039;s even a few tears.  If you&#039;re not moved by Adam&#039; story, then check yourself for a pulse.

&quot;Adam Scully-Power? Never heard of him.&quot;

I get it.  Adam certainly isn&#039;t a household name. But that’s a shame, because we need more guys like Adam.  So I&#039;m doing my part to help change that, because Adam&#039;s story is extraordinary.  And one that needs to be more widely heard.
I&#039;ll start off with this -- talking to Adam was like staring in a mirror.  Not because we look alike - we don&#039;t.  But I have never met anyone with a story that so closely tracks the facts and emotions my own experience. In fact, it&#039;s downright eerie.  So let&#039;s break it down.
Much like me, Adam is a happily married family man and father of four.  
Much like me, Adam had a denial-snapping middle-aged come-to-Jesus moment of reckoning catalyzed by his ever-expanding waistline, quickly deteriorating energy levels and dissatisfaction with his overworked, all-too-sedentary corporate lifestyle.
Much like me, Adam turned to his health-conscious wife for a little guidance, who at the time had been experimenting -- and finding success -- with a plant-based way of eating.
Much like me, and with nothing to lose, Adam decided to give this insane idea of just eating plants a whirl.
Here&#039;s the Cliff Notes on what happens next: Adam&#039;s energy levels explode.  Almost overnight, the extra pounds around Adam&#039;s waist melt away, seemingly without effort.  With a vitality he could not previously recall, and for the first time in years, Adam resumes a modest fitness program to burn off all the extra energy coursing through his veins. But incapable of contentedness with &quot;the occasional jog&quot; Adam instead sets his sights higher.  So high, in fact, he becomes determined to achieve his own personal impossible.
Overwhelmed by the tragedy of last year&#039;s Boston Marathon, driven by an undeniable primal urge to test the outer limits of his physical, mental, emotional and spiritual limits, and propelled by a series of eerie, impossibly synchronistic and equally improbable events -- including an image texted to him by his friend David Green from the Boston Marathon finish line that led to the capture of bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev --  last summer Adam lined up to attempt the unimaginable.  An unprecedented 163-mile run across the entire state of Massachusetts.
Adam accomplished this feat. Not in spite of his plant-based diet, but because of his plant-based diet.  A feat made all the more remarkable because it occurred only one year subsequent to his epiphanic, life-changing moment of reckoning.
To be sure, Adam Scully-Power&#039;s story of life transformation is nothing short of miraculous.  An extraordinary journey that didn&#039;t just repair his health and resolve his waistline dilemma, but instead resulted in astonishing heights of accomplishment he could have never previously imagined in his wildest fantasy.  A story of such dramatic life transformation you will be left in tears -- and beyond inspired.
Of course, not all of us have the desire to test ourselves as ultrarunners.  That&#039;s not the point.  What&#039;s important is the power that resides within all of us to change, achieve and be so much more than we think we can.  Inside all of us resides a better, more authentic version of ourselves yearning to be expressed.  It&#039;s never too late.  And when desire meets faith, there is always a way.
May this conversation be of service to you along the path of your own journey of greater self-realization and expression, in whatever form that may take.

		<itunes:summary>American Ninja Warrior.  Calisthenics freak.  Battlebar champion.  Muscle Beach staple.  Parkour artist.  Spiritual crusader. Social entrepreneur.
These are just a few labels we can attach to the badass known as Travis Brewer.  But what is truly inspiring about this airborne athlete with a conscience is his mission to live life to the fullest. Catalyzing positive impact through movement to make the world a better place.  And inspire others to become more of who they are.  
For Travis, it&#039;s an inside job.  His ability to walk through fear, break barriers, push past physical, mental and emotional plateaus to perform the impossible with death-defying body movement begins and ends with one thing - his devotion to spirituality &amp; meditation.
Today Julie and I sit down with Travis to explore the boundaries of human potential - both athletic and beyond the monkey bars; what it truly means to unlock the best of who you are; the crucial extent to which devotion, spirituality and meditation play into his holistic health and peak performance equation; and how he pursues happiness and life satisfaction through service to others.
Travis is a fascinating, insightful, considerate and contemplative young man with big dreams for the future of youth, health, movement and entrepreneurship. It was an honor to have him spend an evening with our family, and I&#039;m thrilled to share this conversation with you.
Enjoy!

		<itunes:summary>What do you do when your twelve-year-old son announces he’s going to run across America?
That&#039;s the dilemma Brett &amp; Kris Wilcox faced, hoping that in time their son David would simply forget about his crazy idea --

&quot;it&#039;s a phase....he&#039;ll grow out of this fantasy eventually......right?&quot;

Well, David refused to let up.  In fact, he doubled down.  On the heels of becoming the fastest freshman cross country runner in his region of Alaska, David became more determined than ever to become the 2nd 15-year old ever to complete a transcontinental run.
Needless to say, his parents had a decision to make - quash their son&#039;s dream, or dig deep to help make it happen.  I am happy to say they chose the latter. And on January 18, 2014, David and his father -- supported by his mother Kris and 13-year old sister Olivia -- began their coast-to-coast attempt, launching from Huntington Beach, CA en route to Washington, D.C.
David has his motivations.  But in order to run alongside his son, Brett needed his own.
As a Licensed Professional Counselor, Brett has spent his career helping people heal from the poison and pain they’ve endured at the hands of bullies and batterers.  Now, he&#039;s turned his attention to global bullies—bullies like the giant chemical companies that poison the Earth, our political processes and our agricultural system. The author of We&#039;re Monsanto: Feeding the World Lie After Lie, Brett knows a thing or two about GMO&#039;s, the ills of factory farming, the depletion of our soil, and the future of food.  
So Brett -- and David -- are running across America to say enough is enough. And during the course of our conversation we dig deep into these issues -- what exactly these companies are doing to our food system, why we should care, and what we can do about it.
It&#039;s a fascinating conversation and one I am proud to share with you.  What this humble family has set out to accomplish is extraordinary.  But they can&#039;t do it alone.  Every great accomplishment requires the support of a great team.  They need all the help they can get.  So let&#039;s be that team for them.  Towards that end, I implore you to visit their Indiegogo fundraising page and -- if it feels right to you -- consider contributing to their mission and advocacy -- a cause that affects us all, irrespective of dietary preference, geographical location or political prediliction.
I hope you enjoy the conversation!
NOTE: Unfortunately we did experience some audio quality issues with the recording.  Just when I think I have this whole thing figured out!  Something about my mic being too hot and the others lower.  I don&#039;t know.  Tyler worked really hard to clean it up, but it&#039;s not perfect.  Hope it&#039;s not too distracting, and all I can say is that I will continue to try harder, learn and do better.  Give Tyler a shoutout in the comments below, he&#039;s doing a great job as my producer.  And all the music cues are his own original compositions.

What do you do when your twelve-year-old son announces he’s going to run across America?
That's the dilemma Brett &amp; Kris Wilcox faced, hoping that in time their son David would simply forget about his crazy idea --

"it's a phase....he'll grow out of this fantasy eventually......right?"

Well, David refused to let up.  In fact, he doubled down.  On the heels of becoming the fastest freshman cross country runner in his region of Alaska, David became more determined than ever to become the 2nd 15-year old ever to complete a transcontinental run.
Needless to say, his parents had a decision to make - quash their son's dream, or dig deep to help make it happen.  I am happy to say they chose the latter. And on January 18, 2014, David and his father -- supported by his mother Kris and 13-year old sister Olivia -- began their coast-to-coast attempt, launching from Huntington Beach, CA en route to Washington, D.C.
David has his motivations.  But in order to run alongside his son, Brett needed his own.
As a Licensed Professional Counselor, Brett has spent his career helping people heal from the poison and pain they’ve endured at the hands of bullies and batterers.  Now, he's turned his attention to global bullies—bullies like the giant chemical companies that poison the Earth, our political processes and our agricultural system. The author of We're Monsanto: Feeding the World Lie After Lie, Brett knows a thing or two about GMO's, the ills of factory farming, the depletion of our soil, and the future of food.  
So Brett -- and David -- are running across America to say enough is enough. And during the course of our conversation we dig deep into these issues -- what exactly these companies are doing to our food system, why we should care, and what we can do about it.

		<itunes:summary>Matt is a cool dude.  Can&#039;t believe it took the podcast for us to finally meet in person.
Not only do we have plenty of common points of interest and intersection -- plant-based nutrition, eating for performance and ultra-endurance athletics topping the list -- Matt knows from whence he comes.
With a Nutritional Science degree from Pennsylvania State University and a Public Health Nutrition degree from Loma Linda University (yes - that &quot;Blue Zone&quot; Loma Linda where everyone eats plants and lives like forever - don&#039;t worry we get into this), as well as certification as a Registered Dietitian (the only professional nutrition credential available), Matt has distinguished himself as a leading expert in the field of vegan nutrition.
In addition to working one-on-one with clients and athletes, Matt is the Past-Chair of the Vegetarian Nutrition Group of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and co-authored both the No Meat Athlete book with RRP #54 guest Matt Frazier and the best-selling cookbook Appetite for Reduction with Isa Moskowitz.  In his spare time, Matt is an accomplished athlete who races marathons, iron-man triathlons, 200+ mile cycling events and 24-hour races (see full athletic resume).
During the course of our conversation we dig into all of it - the paleo vs. vegan &quot;debate&quot;, how to eat for ultra-endurance performance, modern advocacy in the world of our broken food system, and how corporate interests use marketing to obfuscate fact, undermine informed consent and confuse consumer choice.
But quite possibly the most impressive thing about Matt? He lives in Southern California yet refuses to own a car.  Now that is commitment.
Listen with an open mind, and may the conversation raise the vibration &amp; inspire your best self.  Enjoy!

		<itunes:summary>People ask me all the time, &quot;Who inspires you, Rich?&quot;

For the most part, the people that inspire me are people you&#039;ve never heard of.  Everyman guys like Josh LaJaunie who toil tirelessly yet essentially anonymously to actualize profound personal change.  The single dad working two jobs that still finds a way to lose 50 pounds, get off his statin medication and run his first 10K.  Or the soldier stationed in the Middle East doing his best to eat plant-based despite confronting tremendous daily obstacles.

Then there are guys like Charlie.

The story of Charlie Engle first found it&#039;s way into my consciousness back around 2006 or 2007.  I still vividly recall hearing Charlie relate the facts of his experience in a radio interview he did with a host I cannot recall.  What I do recall is just how moved I was by his journey.  A story that didn&#039;t just click with me, but one I related to with every fiber of who I am.

Addict.  Alcoholic.  Sober. Ultrarunner.  Father.  Felon.  Inspiration.

Charlie is a man of very high highs and very low lows.  A man with addiction and athletic stories of Gilgamesh proportions that make Finding Ultra sound like pre-school recess.  An alcoholic crack addict essentially living out of his car, it took gunshots in his Toyota 4-Runner and the birth of his son in 1992 to finally get sober.  Ultrarunning became the focus of his affections, an affair that took him to stunning heights and accolades, the nadir being an unprecedented 111-day run across the Sahara Desert with compadres Ray Zahab and Kevin Lin -- a feat chronicled in the Matt Damon narrated documentary entitled Running the Sahara.

Life was pretty good.  Certainly not entirely balanced, but hey, nobody&#039;s perfect.  He had done some amazing things. Maybe he had a shot at some modicum of happiness after all.

Then came quite possibly the most improbable, unpredictable challenge he could ever imagine facing.  A saga with all the trappings of a bad B-movie.  An obsessed local IRS agent illogically hell-bent on justice.  Wire taps.  Garbage probes.  And the requisite wily female dispatched to enchant and entrap.  A saga culminating in a federal conviction for mortgage fraud for misstating income on so-called &quot;liar loan&quot; documents (something hundreds of thousands of people did), Charlie heads to Beckley Federal Prison in West Virginia.  A poster child for everything awry with the mortgage backed security crisis and fallout of recent years, Charlie serves 16 months.

How do you survive something like that?

And yet Charlie comes out the other side not just intact, but quite possibly more whole than when he entered.  A man changed by the experience, but maybe more attuned to what really matters.

And a man running better than ever.  Just one year after his release, Charlie returned to the Badwater 135 to clock a 5th place finish and break the master&#039;s world record by over 3 hours.  Next up?  Aside from getting married this weekend, Charlie will attempt to run across the United States faster than any human being ever has previously.  A feat he calls Run 2 Boston, Charlie and wheelchair athlete extraordinaire André Kajlic will line up at the LA Marathon on March 9, complete the 26.2 miles and then just keep going.  And going.  Until they reach Boston, where they will run that marathon.  All in an effort to raise funds and awareness for the victim&#039;s of last years&#039; Boston Marathon bombing.  The idea is to complete the distance in 44 days, which means averaging 70 miles a day.

70 miles of running every day for 44 days straight.

Wow.  Is that even possible?  And after everything he has endured, why?  For the nitty gritty, you&#039;ll have to tune in.  This is a conversation I&#039;ve been dying to have for a very long time, and it didn&#039;t disappoint.  I hope you enjoy it.

		<itunes:summary>S$#*t&#039;s about to get raw.  Authentic.  And real.
Back by popular demand, Cro-Mags&#039; frontman John Joseph -- aka &quot;Blotclot&quot; -- returns to the podcast today to do what he does best - light fires, blow stuff up and burn the house down.  All for the sake of getting people to wake up, expand consciousness and take control of our lives.
Weaned from the ailing womb of Scorsese&#039;s Mean Streets, JJ is a true American original.  Lower East Side thief, abuse survivor, drug dealer &amp; brawling gutter rat reborn as spiritual warrior.  CBGB Street Poet.  Punk-ass Robin Hood.  Plantpowered Ironman.  Spiritual evangelist.  A life story so astounding it echoes some demented amalgam of Bukowski, Hugh Selby, Jr., Jerry Stahl, Eckhart Tolle &amp; Paramahansa Yogananda.
Plus he can write.  His tale of survival is so vividly depicted in his autobiography Evolution of a Cro-Magnon, it&#039;s currently being adapted into a movie.  And July 2014 brings Harper Collins&#039; wide release of his previously self-published (and currently out-of-print) cult hit Meat is For Pussies -- with a foreword by yours truly.
But more anything, this boy can spin a yarn.  JJ&#039;s first appearance on the podcast was a massive hit, and we barely scratched the surface of John&#039;s ability to opine and pontificate on a vast array of subjects -- life on the streets, GMO&#039;s, Monsanto, the strange history of Aspartame, the power of meditation, the importance of expanding consciousness, the problems with the &quot;V&quot; word, what it means to be truly punk in this post-millenia era, and why meat really is for pussies.
If you&#039;re new to the show, be sure to check out JJ&#039;s previous appearance in RRP 41.  It&#039;s like a bomb exploding in an elevator.

		<itunes:summary>Third time&#039;s a charm.
Show favorite Mishka Shubaly returns to the podcast today for round 3 to chat about addiction, sobriety, rock &#039;n roll, ultrarunning, relationships, writing, creativity and his fantastic new Kindle Single, Beat The Devil.
But mostly we talk about chasing dreams.  The inherent force, value &amp; gestalt of a dream.  How much you are willing to sacrifice in pursuit of a dream, even when it constantly deludes and eludes you, undermining, derailing and even destroying other important aspects of your life.  How to know whether the dream you seek is the right dream.  And when -- and if -- it ever makes sense to abandon a dream that persistently fails to materialize.
Mishka and I have a shorthand.  A large percentage of our friendship has taken place on microphone, but there is a palpable sense that we have always been friends.  And that&#039;s because -- although our life experiences are very different -- our mental &amp; emotional points of reference share powerful common turf.  Indeed, Mishka is my brother-from-another-mother; and once again it comes through undeniably in this exchange.
Our bond aside, I feel an imperative to share his palpable creative voice.  A master of humility, self-deprecation, frailty and fear, his evocative prose is a dagger into the heart we all share -- our common condition as human.  It&#039;s an important voice, worthy of notice and praise.  An opinion I harbor not in isolation, but one shared by the literati, including a top editor at The Atlantic who goes so far as to say Mishka is &quot;the voice of our generation&quot;.  That phrase gets bandied about all too commonly, but in Mishka&#039;s case it&#039;s truth.  With 4 consecutive Amazon #1 bestsellers (Shipwrecked, The Long Run, Are You Lonesome Tonight? and Bachelor Number One) he is a true master of the short narrative.  Now he&#039;s back at it.  Beat The Devil -- his newest offering -- just hit #1 in Amazon&#039;s Kindle Singles category yesterday.
A deep dive into the downtown New York rock &#039;n roll club scene, Beat The Devil is Mishka&#039;s first-hand account of battling his ultimate demon and addiction: his obsession with rock &#039;n&#039; roll. Over three decades, this affliction has spawned immeasurable chaos and destruction (and, yes, maybe some debauched good times). While his rivals graced the covers of Spin and Rolling Stone, Shubaly&#039;s projects always flamed out in the eleventh hour. At 36, sober and stable, Shubaly is poised to finally achieve the rock &#039;n&#039; roll glory he has lusted after for years... or walk away from his lifelong dream forever.  Shubaly spares no gory detail in this autopsy of his wasted years and Beat The Devil is rife with vivid behind-the-scenes desperation borne out of chasing an unattainable dream.
Everything that has endeared Shubaly to his readers is here: his resistance to common sense, his inability to accept defeat, his probing intellect, and his heart. 
Do yourself a service a pick up this literary gem.  At $1.99, it&#039;s less than the price of a coffee at Starbucks with a bittersweet aftertaste that will haunt, charm and never leave you.  Plus it&#039;s short - at 73 pages it will only take you about 90 minutes to read the whole thing.  Prefer his voice? It&#039;s available in audiobook format as well - Mishka himself reading it.  And if you enjoy it as much as I know you will, do him a solid and give it a kind review on Amazon.  Let&#039;s support this guy!

Finally, the episode takes us out with Mishka&#039;s new single: I Can&#039;t Remember When You Were Mine.  If you dig his vibe, check out his tunes on Bandcamp.  Finally, finally, that&#039;s Mishka&#039;s nephew in the picture - not his son.
Thanks for dropping by and I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.
NOTE: Some explicit language, so pop the earbuds in if you are at work or driving around with the kiddies.
If you are new to the show and new to Mishka, then you might enjoy our two previous podcast conversations.  Check out Episode 27 &amp; Episode 31.

		<itunes:summary>Now for something a little different.  In celebration of our 1st year anniversary and the quickly approaching new year, I thought it would be fun to compile a &quot;Best Of&quot; edition of the show, with excerpts from some of the more popular interviews over the course of the past twelve months to create a year-end mashup episode.
So Tyler, my son and esteemed podcast producer, audio engineer and musician (he writes, produces and arranges all the music for the show as well) rolled up his sleeves and went to work, spending hours culling through the best and the brightest of 2013 to create today&#039;s show - a full-length compendium of awesome, it&#039;s a veritable grab-bag cornucopia of amazing conversational clips edited together to create a complete show.  Excerpted interviews include the following past guests, in chronological order:
THE BEST OF THE RRP - 2013

NutritionFacts.org Founder Dr. Michael Greger (Episode 7)
Julie Piatt on New Year&#039;s Resolutions (Episode 9)
Ironman World Champion Chris &quot;Macca&quot; McCormack (Episode 24)
Fruitarian Ultra-Runner Michael Arnstein (Episode 26)
Writer &amp; Ultra-Runner Mishka Shubaly (Episode 27)
Australian Television, Radio &amp; Podcast Host Osher Günsberg (Episode 30)
PlantPowered Ironman, Author and Cro-Mags&#039; Frontman John Joseph (Episode 41)
PlantPowered Ironman &amp; Weight Loss Surgeon Dr. Garth Davis (Episode 50)
Olympic Cyclist &amp; Motivational Life Coach Dr. Jeff Spencer (Episode 57)
SunLife Organics Founder Khalil Rafati (Episode 61)

For show notes and to learn more about these guests, click the corresponding episode hyperlinks, above.  Also, we didn&#039;t want to include too much from very recent shows (even though some of them have been incredibly popular), as they are still so fresh.  For this reason, and because we have so many new subscribers who most likely have only listened to the most recent shows, we decided to focus on the early guests.  
If you&#039;re miffed because I left your personal favorite out, I get it.  So many amazing guests over the year it was almost impossible to make a selection -- it&#039;s like trying to figure out who&#039;s going to be your groomsmen at your wedding.  But we had to pick 10.  Not the definitive last word on the best of the best by any means - just good mix nonetheless.  
If you&#039;re brand spanking new to the show, this should give you a really good feel for what we&#039;re all about here at the RRP.
If you enjoy this assemblage and would like another such episode, let me know in the comments below -- if the demand is there, we&#039;ll do another one.  Also, give Tyler a high five in the comments.  He worked his butt off on this one!
NOTE: I am currently overseas in Casablanca, Morocco (the thumbnail episode image above was taken on this morning&#039;s run here, the historical Hassan Mosque in the background).  I brought all my fancy podcast gear with me, but this morning when I plugged in my mixing board with my international power converter, it made a loud &quot;pop&quot; noise, started to smoke, then everything went black - something about the difference in voltage here I suppose.  In any event, my gear fried, this compelled me to record the show introduction and interstitial intros on my iPhone voice recorder - hence the poor audio on those clips.  More important to me to get the show up and out rather than wait until I can get my hands on a new board.  So the audio will have to do.  In addition, many of the excerpted interviews are from very early on in the show&#039;s history -- a time when I knew far less about how to properly record than I do now (not that I currently DO know what I am doing -- for the most part I still have no idea what I&#039;m doing).  Anyway, I hope you don&#039;t find it too distracting.  And go easy on me.  I&#039;m sensitive like that.
That said, enjoy the show!

		<fullsummary>Now for something a little different.  In celebration of our 1st year anniversary and the quickly approaching new year, I thought it would be fun to compile a "Best Of" edition of the show, with excerpts from some of the more popular interviews over the course of the past twelve months to create a year-end mashup episode.
So Tyler, my son and esteemed podcast producer, audio engineer and musician (he writes, produces and arranges all the music for the show as well) rolled up his sleeves and went to work, spending hours culling through the best and the brightest of 2013 to create today's show - a full-length compendium of awesome, it's a veritable grab-bag cornucopia of amazing conversational clips edited together to create a complete show.  Excerpted interviews include the following past guests, in chronological order:
THE BEST OF THE RRP - 2013

NutritionFacts.org Founder Dr. Michael Greger (Episode 7)
Julie Piatt on New Year's Resolutions (Episode 9)
Ironman World Champion Chris "Macca" McCormack (Episode 24)
Fruitarian Ultra-Runner Michael Arnstein (Episode 26)
Writer &amp; Ultra-Runner Mishka Shubaly (Episode 27)
Australian Television, Radio &amp; Podcast Host Osher Günsberg (Episode 30)
PlantPowered Ironman, Author and Cro-Mags' Frontman John Joseph (Episode 41)
PlantPowered Ironman &amp; Weight Loss Surgeon Dr. Garth Davis (Episode 50)
Olympic Cyclist &amp; Motivational Life Coach Dr. Jeff Spencer (Episode 57)
SunLife Organics Founder Khalil Rafati (Episode 61)

For show notes and to learn more about these guests, click the corresponding episode hyperlinks, above.  Also, we didn't want to include too much from very recent shows (even though some of them have been incredibly popular), as they are still so fresh.  For this reason, and because we have so many new subscribers who most likely have only listened to the most recent shows, we decided to focus on the early guests.  
If you're miffed because I left your personal favorite out, I get it.  So many amazing guests over the year it was almost impossible to make a selection -- it's like trying to figure out who's going to be your groomsmen at your wedding.  But we had to pick 10.  Not the definitive last word on the best of the best by any means - just good mix nonetheless.  
If you're brand spanking new to the show, this should give you a really good feel for what we're all about here at the RRP.
If you enjoy this assemblage and would like another such episode, let me know in the comments below -- if the demand is there, we'll do another one.  Also, give Tyler a high five in the comments.  He worked his butt off on this one!
NOTE: I am currently overseas in Casablanca, Morocco (the thumbnail episode image above was taken on this morning's run here, the historical Hassan Mosque in the background).  I brought all my fancy podcast gear with me, but this morning when I plugged in my mixing board with my international power converter, it made a loud "pop" noise, started to smoke, then everything went black - something about the difference in voltage here I suppose.  In any event, my gear fried, this compelled me to record the show introduction and interstitial intros on my iPhone voice recorder - hence the poor audio on those clips.  More important to me to get the show up and out rather than wait until I can get my hands on a new board.  So the audio will have to do.  In addition, many of the excerpted interviews are from very early on in the show's history -- a time when I knew far less about how to properly record than I do now (not that I currently DO know what I am doing -- for the most part I still have no idea what I'm doing).  Anyway, I hope you don't find it too distracting.  And go easy on me.  I'm sensitive like that.
That said, enjoy the show!

		<itunes:summary>This interview is like nothing you have heard before on this show.
It will move you.  It will inspire you.  It will erase whatever obstacles and excuses you rely on that perpetuate bad habits, keep you stuck, and reinforce denial.  By listening, my hope is that you will realize that no matter what your circumstances or environment, we all have the power to implement profound personal change beyond our collective imagination in miraculous and fantastic ways.
A couple weeks ago, a guy called Josh LaJaunie tweeted me his before and after pictures, thanking me for helping him along his journey of total transformation.  Bear in mind, I get many such images sent to me.  I absolutely love this stuff - It&#039;s why I do what I do.  But something about this post was different.  The change was so astounding, my first thought was, &quot;Can this be real?&quot;  The 400+ pound guy on the left bore almost no resemblance to the guy on the right, a super fit, super handsome young man running with a big smile on his face.  And yet when I looked closely, I could indeed determine that it was in fact the same person.  I was stunned.
Chris Farley had morphed into Bradley Cooper.  But how?
I had to find out.  I reached out to him, and we exchanged a few e-mails.  Then he sent me a document, with a title that says it all.

&quot;FREE JOSH LAJAUNIE&quot;

A manifesto on life transformation, it&#039;s the detailed personal account of how Josh accomplished what some would deem impossible, dropping over 200 pounds and a life-long addiction to unhealthy foods &amp; lifestyle habits to discover a passion for running.  A journey that led him to completing a half-marathon and preparing for his first marathon.  He didn&#039;t just lose weight -- he became an athlete.
But what truly struck me wasn&#039;t just the weight loss or his discovered passion for running.  It was the story of how he faced, battled and overcame astounding, impossibly entrenched cultural obstacles to change everything about how he lives his life.  A gift he now freely shares, transforming the lives not just of his family members, but his beloved community at large.  At that moment, I knew I needed to share his story with you.

Born &amp; bred in southern Louisiana, Josh is a 100% genuine, authentic, self-avowed &quot;swamp dweller&quot; from Bayou Lafourche.  Someone who shirks at the label &quot;cajun&quot; as too highfalutin, and &quot;proud to sound like a coonass&quot;.  A big kid surrounded by a loving nuclear and extended family united by their shared love of food -- a regional imperative -- Josh was a standout high school football player, recruited to play college ball.  But disillusioned by college life in Arkansas, he dropped out of school, only to return home, aimless and unmoored.  He found work in the family construction business, but lived for the weekend - time spent hunting, fishing, cheering for his beloved New Orleans Saints, feasting on his favorite local delicacies -- po boys, jambalaya &amp; barbeque.  And partying.  Lots of partying.  It&#039;s just what you do down in Bayou Lafourche.
The weight escalated.  As did the despair.  His embarrassment and shame escalating in equal measure to his declining self-esteem.  Not to mention an almost certain future of diabetes and heart disease.
Then something happened.  In 2010, Josh&#039;s beloved Saints achieved the impossible, winning the Super Bowl.  It seems a small thing.  But to Josh it was everything.  Forever altering his perception of what is possible, he began to question the limits he imposed upon himself.  Empowered, he began to &quot;let go of his normal&quot; and dismiss the embedded &quot;that&#039;s just the way it is down here&quot; mentality he was starting to understand often taints the logic of his region.
A chain reaction of events ensued that set Josh on a new trajectory.  A path that involved a return to fitness and the adoption of a 100% plant-based,  PlantPowered diet.  A path that changed his life beyond his imagination.

It&#039;s one thing to &quot;go vegan&quot; in Santa Monica, California.</itunes:summary>

"FREE JOSH LAJAUNIE"

A manifesto on life transformation, it's the detailed personal account of how Josh accomplished what some would deem impossible, dropping over 200 pounds and a life-long addiction to unhealthy foods &amp; lifestyle habits to discover a passion for running.  A journey that led him to completing a half-marathon and preparing for his first marathon.  He didn't just lose weight -- he became an athlete.

Born &amp; bred in southern Louisiana, Josh is a 100% genuine, authentic, self-avowed "swamp dweller" from Bayou Lafourche.  Someone who shirks at the label "cajun" as too highfalutin, and "proud to sound like a coonass".  A big kid surrounded by a loving nuclear and extended family united by their shared love of food -- a regional imperative -- Josh was a standout high school football player, recruited to play college ball.  But disillusioned by college life in Arkansas, he dropped out of school, only to return home, aimless and unmoored.

Forever altering his perception of what is possible, he began to question the limits he imposed upon himself.  Empowered, he began to "let go of his normal" and dismiss the embedded "that's just the way it is down here" mentality he was starting to understand often taints the logic of his region.
A chain reaction of events ensued that set Josh on a new trajectory.  A path that involved a return to fitness and the adoption of a 100% plant-based,  PlantPowered diet.  A path that changed his life beyond his imagination.

It's one thing to "go vegan" in Santa Monica, California.  But it's another thing entirely in Thibodaux, Louisiana.  No plant-friendly restaurants.  No Whole Foods Market.  And essentially zero community support.  An environment where unhealthy food isn't just a choice, but a celebrated cultural imperative.  Some might even say a religion.
That Josh cut against the grain is an understatement.  To embrace a PlantPower lifestyle didn't just mean an open invitation to ridicule.  It meant risking complete social ostracization.
So just how did he do it? I won't spoil the story entirely -- you will have to listen to find out -- but I will leave you with the final words of his testimonial:

"I want to be a voice, an example of the worst offender fixing the wrong. I want to share my story…"

I am proud to give Josh a well-deserved microphone to serve this end.  And I assure you that his extraordinary tale is well worth your precious time.  So put those earbuds to work and get to listening to this true American original.
I hope you enjoy the conversation!

		<itunes:summary>Sometimes I feel like some kind of fringe conspiracy theorist.  I didn&#039;t used to be this way, I promise.  But the more I delve into how things work -- truly work -- the more amazed I am by what I discover.
I don&#039;t care if you are vegan, locavore, pescatarian, paleo, primal, high-carb, low-carb, or slow-carb.  Everyone deserves to be optimally informed when it comes to how our food is harvested, distributed and marketed.  And yet, quite unfortunately, most consumers lack even a basic awareness of the dynamics at play, let alone a working understanding of the formidable economic protocols that function behind the production of meat, fish, eggs, and dairy.
It is incumbent upon all of us to take personal responsibility for educating ourselves about the economic machinations that dominate and drive our food system.  Why? Because these forces affect all of us, irrespective of dietary preference.  And because informed choice is power. 
Today on the show I am pleased to introduce David Robinson Simon, attorney, advocate for sustainable consumption, and author of the newly released Meatonomics -- an important, groundbreaking and astoundingly revelatory deep dive into the potent economic, marketing, regulatory &amp; legislative forces that support the meat and dairy industries&#039; masterful ability to influence and downright undermine informed consumer awareness and decision making when it comes to what -- and how much -- to eat.  
David&#039;s thesis is that such consumer decisions aren&#039;t just misplaced, but in fact manipulated and compelled -- often on an unconscious level -- by the behemoth animal food producers who effectively co-opt consumers’ buying choices with artificially-low prices fueled by out-of-whack farm subsidies; ubiquitous, powerful but misleading marketing campaigns; and heavy control over legislation and regulatory policy at the highest echelons of government. 
Over the course of our conversation, David provides vital insight into how the economics of institutional animal food production hold sway over our spending, eating, health, prosperity, economy, environment and longevity.  A perfect storm of almost conspiratorial circumstances that serve -- in the macro -- to exponentially increase (among other things):

Annual US taxpayer dollars spent to subsidize meat &amp; dairy;
The rapid depletion of our forests &amp; soil;
The level of greenhouse gas emissions that catalyze irrevocable climate change;  
The collapsing of wild fisheries;
The proliferation of &quot;farmed&quot; fisheries;
US dietary cholesterol intake;
The incidence of cancer, diabetes and heart disease related to meat and dairy consumption
Healthcare costs allocated to treat US cases of diseases related to meat and dairy consumption

For a quick source-supported primer, check out David&#039;s Meatonomics Index -- 40 facts and figures that paint a picture of how our meat and dairy intake has spiraled out of control since 1935.
Food for thought.
Thanks for checking out this post and the episode, and I hope you enjoy the conversation.

		<itunes:summary>If you know my story, you know it involves a descent into alcoholism, followed by a hard fought battle to achieve and maintain sobriety. Recovery saved my life, straight up, no exaggeration.  To this day it remains -- and will always remain -- my number one priority.
I don&#039;t talk it about it often on the podcast, but I think it&#039;s an important subject to raise and discuss, particularly as we head into the holidays -- an acutely perilous time for the millions who, alone, isolated and ashamed, privately battle these demons.
Meet Khalil Rafati, founder of Sunlife Organics -- friend, fellow recovery warrior and amazing living example of the profound resiliency of the human body, mind and spirit.  Not only has Khalil overcome unimaginable obstacles to survive, he has defied all odds and miraculously repaired his life wholesale.  A soul now devoted to the service of others, his primary focus on giving back what was so freely given him.
Prepare to have your mind blown.
Khalil&#039;s tale is nothing short of astounding.  From the depths of absolute despair, homeless &amp; hopelessly gripped by heroin addiction, Khalil was hell bent on dying.  And yet somehow, by way of a grace outside himself, Khalil came out the other side.  Not just intact, but repaired.  He didn&#039;t just find sobriety.  He found his true life purpose. 
Today I am so proud to share my friend&#039;s journey.  Behind all the raw intensity and earnest honesty and vulnerability, it is a story I think we can all celebrate.  A story of the impossible.  And at its heart, the story of true redemptive power of the human condition.
Open your mind and heart and let Khalil inspire you.  I can guarantee that after listening to this profound and at times extremely intense conversation, you will understand that all the illusory excuses that imprison and prevent you from growth, health and self-actualization will seem trivial.
For those that are suffering, this one&#039;s for you.  Please know that all is not lost.  There is a solution. And there is hope.  Always hope.
NOTE: In addition to the extreme intensity of the subject matter discussed, this episode also contains a few instances of explicit language.  So if you&#039;re listening with the wee ones or at work, pop in the ear buds.  Nothing to crazy, just a head&#039;s up for the more sensitive members of the audience. 
And should you find yourself in Los Angeles, do me a solid.  Drop by one of Khalil&#039;s Sunlife Organics juice bars (on Pt. Dume in Malibu and in Thousand Oaks at The Lakes), order a green juice (or the Wolverine smoothie -- my favorite) and give Khalil a high five.
I sincerely hope you enjoy the show.  I&#039;m really proud of this one.

	<itunes:subtitle>  I&#039;ve got news for you people.  Like it or not, the holiday season is upon us.   That special time of year when we tend to overeat, overspend and simply overindulge in everything across the board, all in the name of celebratory merriment.</itunes:subtitle>

I&#039;ve got news for you people.  Like it or not, the holiday season is upon us.  
That special time of year when we tend to overeat, overspend and simply overindulge in everything across the board, all in the name of celebratory merriment.  When we&#039;re not charging it on the card or spread paper thin desperately trying to fulfill all the expectations presented, we find ourselves weathering an unnatural battery of social engagements, not to mention the myriad of emotionally hyper-charged landmines presented by extended family get togethers.
The result?  A massive and unnatural outpouring of energy that leaves us utterly depleted -- spit out the other side physically and emotionally exhausted to the core, all too often overweight and riddled with unnecessary debt. 
What if we could approach and experience the holiday season differently?  What if we could revel in the pure joy of the season and emerge in January not just intact but truly enriched -- optimistic, feeling great and energized for all the challenges and adventures presented with the birth of a new year?
Today on the show, Julie and I sit down to hash out all things holiday season with a focus on providing helpful, experience-based strategies to assist in managing the financial pitfalls, dietary challenges, precarious social environments and heightened emotional states presented by this unique time of year.  In my experience, these are issues common to us all.  And yet issues we go to great lengths to avoid dealing with internally, let alone discussing outwardly -- typically out of fear, shame or simply a profound need to keep up appearances -- all of which ultimately leaves us feeling alone and isolated in what for many can become a state of true emotional crisis.  In truth, the exact opposite of what the holidays should be all about.
So rather than deny or repress, let&#039;s talk about it.  Get it all out in the open.  And work on a strategy for a different, positive and uplifting experience.  On today&#039;s agenda:


How to avoid spending money you don&#039;t have;
How to maintain a healthy PlantPowered Diet throughout the season;
How to experience gift giving with children in a different way;
How to navigate and avoid emotional landmines with extended family;
How to say &quot;No&quot; to certain social obligations; and
How to nuture and preserve your physical, emotional &amp; spiritual well being under pressure.


In honor of this week&#039;s episode and the commencement of the holiday season, we will be publishing a new post each day over the next several days, including the below listed holiday recipes discussed in our conversation.  
So make sure you continue to drop in throughout the week for the good stuff.  Here&#039;s the schedule:


How To Maintain Emotional &amp; Financial Sanity During the Holidays - Tuesday 11/12/13
PlantPower Holiday Cooking: Gluten Free Vegan Stuffing Recipe - Wednesday 11/13/13
PlantPower Holiday Cooking: Vegan Mushroom Gravy Recipe - Thursday 11/14/13

		<itunes:summary>For fans of Ben Greenfield, this is Ben like you&#039;ve never heard him before.
For longtime listeners and fans of health &amp; fitness podcasts, Ben Greenfield needs no introduction.  Self-avowed training guinea pig, ardent nutrition student, accomplished multisport athlete, podcast host, blogger and health entrepreneur at Ben Greenfield Fitness and all around good dude.
Ben and I have been acquainted for some years -- but only through the internet.  He was an early guest on this show (RRP #11), I have guested on his podcast as well as his Endurance Planet podcast (HERE), we did a nutrition-oriented Spreecast with Vinnie Tortorich back in February (HERE) and he has written about my exploits a bit as well (HERE).
And yet surprisingly, we had never met in person.  So it was a pleasure to finally sit down with the guy one-on-one so we could dig a bit deeper.  Skype interviews are great, but there is just no substitute for sitting across from someone when you want to have a proper chat.  And this interview gets it done in spades.
Today on the show we talk about a multitude of things, including:

How he turned his passion for health and fitness into a thriving online business
Some keys for entrepreneurial online success;
His experience training for and racing an Ironman on a high fat / low carb ketogenic diet;
His plan for putting on 30lbs of muscle during the upcoming winter months;
Our experiences interviewing Durianrider;
What the lifestyle &quot;hack&quot; (as in #lifehack or #biohack) actually means;
His experience as a homeschooled child and how he homeschools his children;
How his dietary regimen is often misunderstood, his passion for plants &amp; his vegetable garden; and
Ben&#039;s Upcoming Human Performance Course on CreativeLive.

Like many of my guests, I don&#039;t agree with all points &amp; issues raised.  But I truly like and respect Ben, particularly his willingness to engage in all forms of self-experimentation and his transparency when it comes to openly sharing his results.
I hope you enjoy the conversation!

		<itunes:summary>After listening to this interview, you will never again rely on advancing age as an excuse for anything.
Meet the unique force of nature known as Deborah Szekely -- in so many ways, the Godmother of the Wellness Revolution, but also a tireless activist, philanthropist, writer, and friend of Presidents and Hollywood elite.  At 91 years young, Deborah exudes the energy of someone 60 years her junior.  In fact, I have met few people in my life that could match the drive, vision, commitment and boundless vitality she persistently demonstrates when it comes to improving the health and wellness of people across the globe.
Let me paint the picture.  Without Deborah, there is no Jack LaLanne.  No 24-Hour Fitness, Gold&#039;s Gym, Equinox or Soul Cycle, let alone Canyon Ranch or Burke Williams day spas.  In many ways, so much of what we take for granted as part of our daily health and fitness lifestyle experience can be specifically tracked back to the work Deborah and her husband Edmond started in the tiny village of Tecate, Mexico in 1940.
Hailing from Brooklyn by way of Eastern Europe, Deborah&#039;s mother was a progressive raw foodist fruitarian and vice president of the New York Vegetarian Society.  When the Great Depression hit, Deborah&#039;s garment business father moved the family to Tahiti, the land of abundant fruit, to live closer to nature -- and persistently ahead of the curve.  It&#039;s there that they met Edmond Szekely, a prophetic, highly educated and charismatic professor and author of Hungarian origin (then Transylvania) &amp; Jewish heritage prone to long pontifications on the virtues of living in close connection with one&#039;s natural environment.
In her late teens, Deborah became Edmond&#039;s secretary and ultimately his bride.  They later settled in Los Angeles, but with World War II on the horizon and Edmond fearing deportation back to Eastern Europe due to citizenship issues, they decamped to Tecate, about an hour&#039;s drive from San Diego just over the Mexican border.
Domiciled in a tiny cabin on a vast parcel of land at the base of a gorgeous mountain, in 1940 Edmond and Deborah opened their doors to the outside world -- a summer camp they called Rancho La Puerta where visitors could convene for $17.50 per week, provided they brought their own tent.  During the summer months, Edmond would lecture to groups on a number of topics, including the philosophy of The Essenes; something he dubbed Biogenic Living; the ills of smoking (revolutionary at the time); and the virtues of a healthy diet, exercise and living close to nature.
Bear in mind, this was decades before any of these subjects were in vogue.  Not to beat a dead horse, but to say Edmond and Deborah were a step ahead is an understatement.
Not enough? In his downtime, Edmond wrote books -- over 80 titles all told -- and printed them with his own printing press.
Word got out about the interesting happenings of Rancho La Puerta.  Hollywood took notice, and soon people like Burt Lancaster, Kim Novak, William Holden, and even Aldous Huxley could be found spending time at the Ranch.  The Ranch quickly grew, and in later years, Rancho has hosted the likes of Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Barbara Streisand, Martha Stewart and Arianna Huffington.  
The rest is history.  In it&#039;s 73rd year, Rancho La Puerta set the stage for every wellness trend, spa and movement that would follow.  Today the center boasts some of the best wellness programs, most beautiful facilities, finest food and appointed terrain in the world, attracting a vast and loyal global following of repeat clientele.  
Still not enough? Deborah ran for Congress.  Although she didn&#039;t win, she still found herself in Washington, D.C. for 17 years as President of the Inter-American Foundation (IAF), an independent foreign assistance agency of the United States government which furthers grassroots development by awarding grants directly to the organized poor in Latin America, Caribbean, and the groups that support their efforts.

And yet she still is far from done.  At 91, her latest of many passion projects is growing a 501(c)(4) health and wellness focused Super PAC lobbying group to confront and combat big food, agricultural and pharmaceutical companies at the federal and state legislative level -- a project she founded called Wellness Warrior.
All told, it's almost impossible to underestimate the impact Deborah has had on the wellness movement.  We all owe her an incredible debt of gratitude for the work to which she has devoted her life.  And it was an honor to spend a few hours getting to know her better during our recent stay at Rancho.
I hope you enjoy the interview.
NOTE: The audio for this interview is far from stellar.  Although I have worked out the production quality on the studio, I am still having some issues with my travel set up.  I apologize and hope it's not overly distracting.  As always, I will continue to do better.
Finally - enjoying the music cues on the show? Thanks my 18-year old son Tyler Piatt -- not only did he produce and edit today's show, he wrote, arranged and performed all the music as well.  Thanks Tyler!

		<itunes:summary>Success isn&#039;t an accident - it happens by design.
Today on the show I am pleased to host Dr. Jeff Spencer - life coach to Olympic champions and entrepreneurs and architect of a methodology he calls The Champions Blueprint -- the good doctor&#039;s well researched and proven &quot;crystal ball&quot; process to unlock your internal personal power and unleash -- and more importantly sustain -- prolific peak performance, not to mention your best self.
Break out your Moleskins people, because you are going to want to take copious notes.  Class is in session!
Whether on the playing field or in the board room, we often marvel at those few who seem able to effortlessly achieve -- and again sustain -- incredible results.  I&#039;m talking about people like Michael Jordan.  Michael Phelps. Oprah Winfrey.  And Richard Branson.  Freaks of nature, right?  Once in a lifetime talents that deserve our reverence, but simply cannot be emulated, let alone replicated. 
We all want this right?  And yet it seems so elusive.  A struggle that can seem impossible for the average Joe to realize.  Why?
Well. according to Dr. Spencer, this is because we lack one simple thing -- a proper roadmap.  In other words, beyond sheer talent there&#039;s a distinct, consistent method behind the innate gifts of the heroes we are so quick to worship that leads inextricably to achievement and keeps them on top.  A method that indeed can be identified and repeated in everyone&#039;s life.  A method that can set you up for long-term success in not only the goal you seek, but more importantly the legacy that is your life.
Born from the pain he experienced watching his genius artist father die homeless, his work unrecognized, Dr. Spencer began to ask himself: why did this happen, and how can I help others avoid this peril?  Informed by his prolific athletic career as a member of the 1972 US Olympic Team in track cycling and buttressed by his copious experience mentoring world class athletes as a 9-time Tour De France team doctor (chiropractor), Jeff came to truly understand and appreciate that no person succeeds without proper mentors and a supportive team.  Thus he began to identify patterns of predictable human behavior, and how certain predictable behaviors can indeed be harnessed to achieve previously unimaginable heights of achievement.  In turn, this ultimately led him to identify the 7 steps of what would become the foundation of The Champions Blueprint protocol - a curriculum he has used to help many achieve unparalleled, sustained legacy-worthy success.  Here are those steps, which we discuss at length in today&#039;s episode:

Legacy: Start with the End in Mind
Mindset: View the world through the lens of your Legacy
Base: Get the Team, Equipment, Financing and Tangibles in Place
Climb the Wall: 1. Patience 2. Grind | Reach Break Out Performance
Elevation: Shift your Break out Performance to your Daily Program
Adaptation: Can you deal with the pressure of performing at the top?
Ride the Wave: Leaving a Complete Legacy as an Example for Others

I am very proud of this conversation.  Surely, one of my favorite interviews to date, and an exchange that becomes quite emotional at times. An episode worthy of more than one listen.
Thank you Jeff for showing up and demonstrating the courage to be vulnerable.  Wallow in the wisdom people!
Finally - enjoying the music cues on the show? Thanks my 18-year old son Tyler Piatt -- not only did he produce and edit today&#039;s show, he wrote, arranged and performed all the music as well.  Thanks Tyler!

		<itunes:summary>Let me be clear.  Just because you are vegan does not mean you are eating a healthy diet.
Today Julie and I sit down with the wonderful Chef AJ to talk about the enormous difference between a simple &quot;animal product free&quot; diet and a whole food plant-based diet.
I knew AJ was an amazing plant-based chef.  What I didn&#039;t know was her inspiring story of personal transformation.  The story of an overweight, junk food vegan on the brink of serious health calamity who found salvation in the whole food plant-based lifestyle.
Tune in and let her tell you how she overcame her food addictions to become the health advocate she is today.  Her responses might surprise you.
AJ is a kick in the pants.  It was tons of fun chatting with her.  I sincerely hope you enjoy the interview.  And if you are in California and happen to stop in a Sharky&#039;s restaurant, ask for the AJ Burrito!

		<itunes:summary>Now for something a little different.  Meet Adam Dole - a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow currently studying the various ways technology can improve our healthcare system.
Adam leverages an expertise in human behavior and sociology to help technology improve lives.  A rare and specific skill set that landed him a coveted gig at NASA problem solving Mars mission human transport issues and subsequently led to various entrepreneurial stints at Silicon Valley start ups.  A developing interest in health and wellness then found Adam spearheading technology innovation for the Mayo Clinic, more specifically a project he conceptualized called Blue Button -- a healthcare software application empowering consumer access to healthcare and medical record information.
The White House took notice.  And before he knew it, Adam found himself in Washington as part of the prestigious Presidential Innovation Fellow program.  Under the direction of White House CTO Todd Park, Adam spends his days (at least before the government shutdown!) studying the intersection of technology and our health care system with the purpose of identifying opportunities for cooperative collaboration between healthcare executives, government bureaucrats and technology entrepreneurs to identify and execute systemic, functional healthcare improvements for the benefit of the consumer.
Adam is an energetic and fun guy.  His enthusiasm and passion for his work is infectious.  Work that is and will improve lives - no question.  Adam gives me hope and optimism that we can conquer the challenges faced by healthcare.  I truly enjoyed our conversation and think you will too.
For a really nice feel for where Adam is coming from, check out this piece he co-authored for Fast Company Magazine: &quot;Empathize Like A Doctor, Design Like An Entrepreneur&quot;

		<itunes:summary>All hail the running carrot!  Today on the show I&#039;m joined by my pal Matt Frazier, the guy behind the wildly successful NoMeatAthlete.com -- website, podcast and roadmap series of downloadable tools -- an absolute go to resource chock-a-block with information for runners and triathletes of all abilities looking to take their athletic &amp; nutrition game to the next level.
Matt founded NoMeatAthlete in 2009, about the same time he went vegetarian. Six months later, Matt qualified for the Boston Marathon with a time of 3:09:59 at the Wineglass Marathon, over 100 minutes faster than his first marathon time seven years prior. In June 2010, Matt ran his first 50-mile ultramarathon, recently completed his first 100-mile race and has run several more ultras and marathons each year since.
What&#039;s great about Matt is his sincerity, authenticity, transparency and relatability.  He&#039;s not a world-class athlete, just a friendly, smart and resourceful guy who started experimenting with running and diet and wanted to share what he was learning.  A site that started out as little more than a personal document of his experiment in food and fitness, NoMeatAthlete has morphed over the last few years into one of the web&#039;s leading resources when it comes to information relating to the intersection of running and plant-based lifestyle.
The best part? Matt is genuinely a really nice guy.  A guy you just want to see win.  Like Rudy -- a comparison that will put a smile of irony on your face when you hear our parting words at the end of the interview.
Now Matt has taken all he has learned, and synthesized it into a new Book: No Meat Athlete: Run on Plants and Discover Your Fittest, Fastest, Happiest Self -- do yourself a favor and check it out.  Let&#039;s support this guy!
Finally - a note of thanks.  Just a few days ago we surpassed ONE MILLION DOWNLOADS of the podcast.  That&#039;s right.  A cool million.  That just blows my mind wide open.  Does not compute.  Surreal.  It&#039;s all because of you. So thank you - for everything.  There have been ups.  There have been downs.  And more recently, controversy (see comments on Episode 53 with Durianrider - holy smokes).  I appreciate you for sticking around.  I am truly humbled and more energized than ever to continue the mission.  So much great stuff to come.
I hope you enjoy the show.

		<itunes:summary>Ask and ye shall receive.  Today is Durianrider day on the podcast.  And he has a message for you:
Carb the f$%@ up!
Aka Harley Johnstone, &quot;Durianrider&quot; is a self-avowed health vigilante committed to increasing public awareness of the benefits of a high carbohydrate, low-fat whole food plant-based lifestyle.  A lifestyle modeled upon Doug Graham&#039;s book The 80/10/10 Diet, or what is more commonly referred to as fruitarian -- a dietary protocol based predominantly upon eating copious amounts of fruit.  Let&#039;s just say it&#039;s not uncommon for Harley to proudly devour upwards of 70 bananas a day.
In this regard, Harley is not alone.  Although still on the fringe in terms of mainstream awareness and popularity, the 80/10/10 program is one that is gaining popularity (check out my podcast interviews with Michael Arnstein and Mac Danzig for more).  
But what distinguishes Harley from fellow healthy lifestyle advocates is his unique, personal style.
Outspoken and unequivocal, Harley doesn&#039;t mince words.  At times acerbic, and often on the perimeter of completely outlandish, Harley is a lightning rod for controversy -- a role he relishes.  Proponents of &quot;fad diets&quot; hawking unhealthy and unethical programs or snake oil products get called out.  Taken to the mat.  And on occasion, name-calling is involved.
And don&#039;t even get him started on how he feels about the currently über-popular low-carb / no-carb / ketosis-based diets pushing high protein and copious amounts of fat.
His fans are passionate.  His critics equally so.
But make no mistake -- behind the larger-than-life personality, Harley is in many ways a regular guy leading a simple and active life, committed to helping people feel as good as he does, primarily via his YouTube channel.  A guy frustrated by all the confusing and misleading health, diet and fitness information penetrating the internet, he&#039;s like Howard Beale (Peter Finch) in the 1976 movie &quot;Network&quot; screaming, &quot;I&#039;m mad as hell and I&#039;m not going to take this anymore!&quot;
Durianrider may not be everyone&#039;s cup of tea.  I get it.  So does he.  And he&#039;s fine with that.  But regardless of any preconceived opinions you may harbor, I implore you to listen with an open mind.  
His message is powerful.  And for the record - I like the guy.
I hope you enjoy the show!

	<itunes:subtitle>Ronnie Schildknecht may not be a household name.  But he should be.  Why? because nobody in history has logged a faster Ironman on the soil of this continent faster than Ronnie.  This is a guy who won Ironman Florida in 2011 in 7 hours and 59 minutes.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>Ronnie Schildknecht may not be a household name.  But he should be.  Why? because nobody in history has logged a faster Ironman on the soil of this continent faster than Ronnie.  This is a guy who won Ironman Florida in 2011 in 7 hours and 59 minutes.  An Ironman in under 8 hours!
Just how fast is that? After swimming 2.4 miles in the ocean in 51 minutes, imagine getting on your bike and riding 112 miles at an average pace of almost 26mph for 4 hours and 19 minutes straight.  Then imagine getting off your bike and running a steady 6 minute to 6:15 pace to clock a blazing 2:43 marathon.
Not enough for you?  When Ronnie won Ironman Zurich this summer, he became the only athlete to have won a single Ironman race seven years in a row consecutively.
Beyond his incomprehensible athletic achievements, Ronnie is a man of soft-spoken disposition and considerate nature.  A guy more comfortable letting others bask in the limelight while allowing his race results speak on his behalf.  Refreshing.
What I found most compelling is how Ronnie&#039;s training has evolved over the last few years to a protocol that dispenses with the knee-jerk conventional wisdom of high volume and places more emphasis on high intensity quality work; recovery; mental preparation &amp; visualization; and a protracted taper beyond his previous comfort zone.
Ronnie&#039;s evolution into the elite athlete he is today has required developing a greater understanding of -- and confidence in -- what specifically works for him -- irrespective of the opinions of others, recommended training protocols, or the flavor of the month diet or training plan.
What works for him.  
Powerful.  And simple.  Yet something that nonetheless can be so elusive and difficult to embrace.  For Ronnie, it didn&#039;t come easy at first -- his sub-par Kona performances since his blazing 4th place in 2008 attributable to overtraining and not listening to what his body was telling him.  Why? Because trusting one&#039;s instincts can prove incredibly difficult without extreme personal confidence and practiced mental discipline.  A strong internal compass capable of muting the outside world.  Healthy boundaries.  And a profound sense of self.
Whether you are an athlete yourself or just a fan, Ronnie&#039;s message of personal responsibility and self-awareness is powerful -- principles that transcend sport -- applicable to life wherever you find yourself.
And I have no doubt that after listening to this interview, like me you&#039;ll be a Ronnie fan, ready to cheer him on to Ironman victory in Kona.
I hope you enjoy the show. 
PS - Here&#039;s a really nice video from Ironman.com profiling Ronnie in his lead up to winning his 7th consecutive Ironman Zurich. Well worth the watch!

		<itunes:summary>The lovely and powerful Julie Piatt -- my sometime co-host and all-time wife -- returns to the show today to share some interesting perspectives on children&#039;s education -- more specifically, homeschooling.  And even more specifically, the Unschooling method of homeschooling.
I know.  It&#039;s controversial.  I get it.  But the subject also brings to mind one of my favorite quotes from one of the brightest minds of Victorian England - scientist, philosopher and theologian Herbert Spencer.  It appears in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, and goes like this:

&quot;There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance -- that principle is contempt prior to investigation.&quot;

Translation - listen with an open mind.  Because growth, change and expansion cannot occur without doing so.
Other topics on today&#039;s episode agenda include:
My recent speaking engagements in Toronto and Tucson;
My increased involvement in an exciting new documentary project entitled Game Changers about plant-based athletes, currently in production -- produced by former podcast guest James Wilks (Episode 16) and some of the people that brought you Forks Over Knives;
Witnessing Patrik Baboumian&#039;s world record-setting strongman lift &amp; carry in Toronto;
My impending visits to Karachi, Bahrain and Casablanca to spread the PlantPower message;
Creating a PlantPower Halloween Movement; and
Beyond Meat&#039;s quest to disrupt Big Food with its perfect plant-based chicken and beef alternatives.
During our conversation, Julie references Sir Ken Robinson and his opinions about our education system.  I can&#039;t urge you strongly enough to take a few minutes to watch his powerful TED Talk on how schools kill creativity.  There is a reason it&#039;s the most watched TED Talk of all time (almost 18 million views), so please take the time to open your mind to this:

And here&#039;s my view through my trusty GoPro of Vegan Strongman Patrik Baboumian carrying 1216 pounds for 10 meters, breaking a Guinness Book of World Record for most weight ever lifted by a human being - ever.

		<itunes:summary>Today on the show I have the great pleasure of conversing with Dr. Garth Davis -- a veteran weight loss surgeon who took it upon himself to determine exactly why so many people are plagued by obesity; a quest that led him down a deep research hole to identify the ultimate human diet to maximize health -- both for himself and his patients.

About 6 years ago, the good doctor became his own patient.  At the time, he was suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and a fatty liver.  In short, he was pretty sick.  Not surprising given the demanding hours of the surgeon lifestyle, lack of exercise, a preference for salty, fatty foods, and the convenience of fast food options in the hospital cafeteria.  In fact, there was a Wendy&#039;s in the University of Michigan hospital where Garth did his internship and residency, resulting in a daily dose of  double cheeseburgers - a habit he maintained for years.

Let&#039;s just say that I can relate.

Conventional dogma in his field is that overweight patients should eat nothing but protein -- hop on board the low carb ketosis bandwagon. Without inquiring further, Garth simply bought into this idea as truth.  He even wrote a book in 2007 advocating this approach to food, called The Experts Guide To Weight Loss Surgery.

The only problem?  This approach to diet failed him and many other friends, colleagues and patients.  He knew there had to be a better solution.  And his patients needed help beyond knee-jerk surgery.  Finally ready for a personal change, he took it upon himself to research -- truly research -- nutrition for the first time, quite ironically given his profession as a weight loss surgeon.  Astoundingly, nutrition just wasn&#039;t on the medical school curriculum, and almost never came up as all that relevant in the countless weight loss surgery symposiums he regularly attended.

His inquiry went deep.  And the more he delved into the peer reviewed research, the more convinced he became that there is absolutely no science to back the long-term health claims surrounding the strongly held belief that if we want to be thin and healthy we should eat a high protein low carbohydrate diet.

What did he find?  First and foremost, that Western Medicine has been failing us when it comes to the most crucial aspect of maintaining health -- nutrition.  And that if we want to achieve ideal weight management, optimal health and long-term wellness, we need to turn conventional wisdom on it&#039;s head and embrace the idea that humans are herbivores.  

That&#039;s right.  Herbivores.  

Sound far-fetched?  Before you balk, understand that adopting this way of eating absolutely revolutionized Garth&#039;s health beyond what he could have imagined.  Not only did he drop the weight that plagued him for years, all of his blood markers suddenly and quite magically normalized.  His allergies vanished.  His sleep improved, his energy levels skyrocketed and he got off his statin medications.  In short, he finally began to walk his talk.  As his life began to turn around, he wanted to be an example to his patients.  For the first time in his life, he began exercising.

Then he did the extraordinary.  Despite never having been an athlete, in 2011 he nonetheless completed Ironman Texas in 12 hours and 6 minutes.

His personal results nothing short of extraordinary, Garth has now become somewhat of a crusader to teach people real nutrition.  How to read scientific literature, and how the internet pseudo-experts are manipulating the science to push high protein diet.  And now he&#039;s in the midst of writing a book on the subject.  The Protein Obsession (Harper Collins / Harper One) should be out next year.

Dr. Davis&#039; opinions on the paleo diet and the low carb diet craze are outspoken and unequivocal.  And don&#039;t get him started on the trendy idea that saturated fat isn&#039;t the enemy and we should all be eating bacon for breakfast.  For his words on these subjects alone,</itunes:summary>
		<fullsummary>Today on the show I have the great pleasure of conversing with Dr. Garth Davis -- a veteran weight loss surgeon who took it upon himself to determine exactly why so many people are plagued by obesity; a quest that led him down a deep research hole to identify the ultimate human diet to maximize health -- both for himself and his patients.

About 6 years ago, the good doctor became his own patient.  At the time, he was suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and a fatty liver.  In short, he was pretty sick.  Not surprising given the demanding hours of the surgeon lifestyle, lack of exercise, a preference for salty, fatty foods, and the convenience of fast food options in the hospital cafeteria.  In fact, there was a Wendy's in the University of Michigan hospital where Garth did his internship and residency, resulting in a daily dose of  double cheeseburgers - a habit he maintained for years.

Let's just say that I can relate.

Conventional dogma in his field is that overweight patients should eat nothing but protein -- hop on board the low carb ketosis bandwagon. Without inquiring further, Garth simply bought into this idea as truth.  He even wrote a book in 2007 advocating this approach to food, called The Experts Guide To Weight Loss Surgery.

The only problem?  This approach to diet failed him and many other friends, colleagues and patients.  He knew there had to be a better solution.  And his patients needed help beyond knee-jerk surgery.  Finally ready for a personal change, he took it upon himself to research -- truly research -- nutrition for the first time, quite ironically given his profession as a weight loss surgeon.  Astoundingly, nutrition just wasn't on the medical school curriculum, and almost never came up as all that relevant in the countless weight loss surgery symposiums he regularly attended.

His inquiry went deep.  And the more he delved into the peer reviewed research, the more convinced he became that there is absolutely no science to back the long-term health claims surrounding the strongly held belief that if we want to be thin and healthy we should eat a high protein low carbohydrate diet.

What did he find?  First and foremost, that Western Medicine has been failing us when it comes to the most crucial aspect of maintaining health -- nutrition.  And that if we want to achieve ideal weight management, optimal health and long-term wellness, we need to turn conventional wisdom on it's head and embrace the idea that humans are herbivores.  

That's right.  Herbivores.  

Sound far-fetched?  Before you balk, understand that adopting this way of eating absolutely revolutionized Garth's health beyond what he could have imagined.  Not only did he drop the weight that plagued him for years, all of his blood markers suddenly and quite magically normalized.  His allergies vanished.  His sleep improved, his energy levels skyrocketed and he got off his statin medications.  In short, he finally began to walk his talk.  As his life began to turn around, he wanted to be an example to his patients.  For the first time in his life, he began exercising.

Then he did the extraordinary.  Despite never having been an athlete, in 2011 he nonetheless completed Ironman Texas in 12 hours and 6 minutes.

His personal results nothing short of extraordinary, Garth has now become somewhat of a crusader to teach people real nutrition.  How to read scientific literature, and how the internet pseudo-experts are manipulating the science to push high protein diet.  And now he's in the midst of writing a book on the subject.  The Protein Obsession (Harper Collins / Harper One) should be out next year.

Dr. Davis' opinions on the paleo diet and the low carb diet craze are outspoken and unequivocal.  And don't get him started on the trendy idea that saturated fat isn't the enemy and we should all be eating bacon for breakfast.  For his words on these subjects alone, this interview is a must-listen if you want the straight up truth about eating right.

We are all capable of doing so much more than we think we can.  Let Dr. Davis inform and inspire your own journey.

Enjoy the show!

		<itunes:summary>Sure, you&#039;ve seen him on shows like CSI and Gilmore Girls.  But today&#039;s guest isn&#039;t just another actor.  He can do some amazing things you can&#039;t.  Very specific things, albeit obscure. Like hold his breath for a full seven minutes.  Or swim 218 meters underwater along the bottom of a pool without coming up for air -- not a single breath.
Welcome to the mind-blowing world of Freediving, explained through the lens of one of the best in the sport -- Australian National Record Holding Champion Tanc Sade.
One of the things I love about the podcast is the excuse to meet compelling people doing amazing things outside the mainstream -- things I would ordinarily never come across in my daily life and yet find utterly compelling.  Freediving certainly fits the bill -- a sport that couldn&#039;t be more different from endurance athletics and yet in certain respects still shares a commonality.
Although the pursuit of excellence in any sport (as in life) require a strong mental game, Freediving requires unparallelled mental &amp; emotional preparation. Learning to control the flexibility of not just your body or your thoughts but even your metabolic process through advanced meditation techniques.  Getting there is the fascinating part, and Tanc shows us how he does it, and why.
And that&#039;s just the beginning.  No spoilers.  Just sit back.  Listen.  And let Tanc blow your mind.
In the interim -- and to just paint the picture for you about what we are talking about here -- have a look at Tanc&#039;s 218-meter Australian national record-setting effort - an event called &quot;Dynamic Apnea&quot;:

NOTE: Tanc is a professional.  You are not.  So no matter how inspired you may be by this interview, please DO NOT attempt your own half-baked unsupervised freediving experiment at home --  any type of breath hold work unsupervised can cause death.  If you are interested in learning more about the sport, research freediving courses and/or clubs in your locale and undertake proper instruction from someone skilled in this discipline.  And if you have additional questions, reach out Tanc on Facebook and he would be happy to advise and guide you in the right direction.

	<itunes:subtitle>Today on the show I chat with Thad Beatty, guitarist for the multi-platinum country duo Sugarland.   In so many ways, Thad&#039;s story closely mirrors mine.  The details are distinct, but no matter -- the journey is all too familiar.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>Today on the show I chat with Thad Beatty, guitarist for the multi-platinum country duo Sugarland.  
In so many ways, Thad&#039;s story closely mirrors mine.  The details are distinct, but no matter -- the journey is all too familiar.  I first came across Thad&#039;s story on Ironman.com and -- struck by the similarities in our journeys -- knew I had to have him on the show.
Just a few years ago, Thad tipped the scales at 230 lbs.  Overweight with raging blood pressure and alarmingly elevated cholesterol, the touring musician lifestyle had him headed in the direction of irrevocable health problems in his mid-30&#039;s.
His decision to turn his life around snapped into focus the day he found out his mother had been diagnosed with colon cancer.  In support and solidarity with mom, both Thad and his brother decided to clean up their act.  It started simple -- ditch the lousy processed foods and start eating more fruits &amp; vegetables.  One thing led to another, and before he knew it, Thad found himself a convert to the PlantPower lifestyle.
Not long thereafter, Thad shed the weight - 75lbs in all -- down to a trim 165 lbs.  Life was good.  But then came another moment of clarity.  Sugarland&#039;s guitar tech was diagnosed with advanced lymphoma.  MusiCares came to his aid, but it was too late.  Kevin Quigley unfortunately passed away in March 2012.
It was at this moment that Thad decided to focus on service -- giving back to his beloved profession.  So was borne his dream of completing an Ironman.  Not for himself, but to raise money for the foundation that had come to his friend&#039;s aid.  Thad achieved his dream, finishing the Arizona Ironman last November, raising funds along the way.
But that was just the beginning.  Thad decided to take his service game to the next level, ultimately establishing his own foundation -- Music That Moves -- dedicated to improving the holistic health and fitness of his fellow musicians beyond the stage through various means, including sharing the lifestyle principles that changed his own life.
And this October he&#039;s taking his game to the main stage -- this time not as a musician but as an athlete -- lining up in Kona to compete at the Ironman World Championships as part of Ironman&#039;s Kona Inspired program.  I&#039;m hoping we&#039;ll all catch a glimpse of Thad and his story when NBC airs the race broadcast.
I hope you enjoy the conversation!
NOTE: There are audio quality issues with this Skype-recorded conversation.  Apologies.  Just when I think I have it all figured out, technology rears it&#039;s ugly head once again.  The good news is the quality improves after the initial 30 minutes of the conversation.  I did my best to clean it up, but it is what it is.  As always, I promise to continually improve, but these things happen.  Go easy on me.
Here&#039;s a little video from Thad from the Kona Inspired site to get you pumped.

		<itunes:summary>Today I sit down with the one and only Joe Cross, the man behind the wildly successful documentary film, &quot;Fat, Sick &amp; Nearly Dead.&quot;
A few eerie parallels.  Joe and I are almost exactly the same age, and we both decided to make radical life changes when we turned 40. So when I began the journey I chronicle in Finding Ultra, Joe began the journey he chronicles in his movie.  And now here we are, sitting across from each other, sharing our respective stories which essentially transpired concurrently.
So what is Joe&#039;s story?  100 pounds overweight, loaded up on prescription meds and suffering from a debilitating autoimmune disease, Joe was at the end of his rope -- a 310lb man whose gut was bigger than a beach ball and a path laid out before him that wouldn&#039;t end well.  With one foot already in the grave, the other wasn&#039;t far behind.
With doctors and conventional medicines unable to help long- term, Joe turned to the only option left, the body&#039;s ability to heal itself. He trades in the junk food and hits the road with juicer and film crew in tow, vowing only to drink fresh fruit and vegetable juice for the next 60 days and see what happens. Across 3,000 miles Joe has one goal in mind: to get off his pills and achieve a balanced lifestyle.
While talking to more than 500 Americans about food, health and longevity, it&#039;s at a truck stop in Arizona where Joe meets a truck driver who suffers from the same rare condition. Phil Staples is morbidly obese weighing in at 429 lbs; a cheeseburger away from a heart-attack. As Joe is recovering his health, Phil begins his own epic journey to get well.
Joe and I get into how Joe saved his life, helped create a populist movement around juicing and his plans for the future.
Joe&#039;s passion for health &amp; self-healing is infectious -- I hope you are inspired by his message to take your own wellness to the next level!

		<itunes:summary>Today I&#039;m joined by my friend and (sometimes) summertime training partner Terenzo Bozzone - 5-time World Champion professional triathlete.
I met &quot;T&quot; right after I completed EPIC5 back in 2010 when he arrived in town along with Chris McCormack for several weeks of intense spring training.  With a gracious poise and maturity well beyond his mere 28 years, Terenzo is one of the brightest stars in professional triathlon, as well as a remarkable ambassador of the sport -- always quick with a kind word of encouragement to his fellow training partners and never too busy to connect on a personal level with his many fans.
I&#039;ve had the honor of getting to spend some quality training time with Terenzo over the last three years and will say this -- the sport of triathlon is a better place with him in it.  T is one of the good guys.  A guy you want to see win.  A guy you can really get behind and root for.  
I&#039;m so pleased that Terenzo took time out of his busy training schedule leading up to his peak race of the season -- The Ironman 70.3 World Championships in Las Vegas just two weeks from today -- to sit down and have a chat about his training, racing and life.
I hope you enjoy the show. No doubt you&#039;ll end up a big fan of all things Terenzo.  So do the guy a solid and let&#039;s all show him some Twitter and facebook love to get him pumped for the big show in Vegas!

		<itunes:summary>Today on the show I sit down with my friend Mac Danzig, a fascinating PlantPowered force in the MMA / UFC world.  
Before we go any further, throw away any UFC fighter stereotypes that may come to mind.  Mac is one of the more intelligent, introspective and out-of-the box thinkers you are likely to meet -- a personality and perspective forged from transcending a challenging upbringing to rise to the highest echelons of the UFC, including victory in Season 6 of the Ultimate Fighter and a decorated career that includes twelve consecutive wins in 2006.
Accomplishments all achieved on a 100% plant-based diet.
I first met Mac a couple years ago and was immediately struck by his contemplative, low key personality.  A guy at peace with himself, far more comfortable alone in nature than navigating the spotlight.  A guy who really thinks about the authenticity of his actions, his place in the world, how to best father his daughter Nova, and the impact his decisions have on others and the planet at large.  So it was fascinating to finally sit down with him and hash it out.  Not short on opinions, Mac broke my record in episode length today, exceeding 3 hours and expounding upon everything from his career and diet (of course) to the benefits of meditation, the perils of our education system and sport as art.  Yeah, it&#039;s a long one.  I know.  But I am really proud of this interview and essentially guarantee that you will be completely engaged throughout.
It&#039;s one thing when a triathlete, marathoner or an ultra-runner demonstrates plantpowered prowess.  We&#039;ve seen that. But what about an athlete whose success depends upon brute strength, lightning speed, incredible power and world-class agility?  Well that&#039;s another thing altogether.  Simply put, Mac&#039;s success takes all the wind out of the tired argument that you cannot excel athletically on a plant-based diet.
Now Mac is taking his game to a whole new level, experimenting with the 80/10/10 Diet - a regimen heralded by Douglas Graham in which 80% of all calories come from carbohydrates, 10% from protein and 10% from fat. Translation?  Most of what he eats is fruit -- a protocol that stands in direct counterpoint to the high fashion, high fat, low carb craze currently in vogue.
How is it working for Mac? You&#039;ll have to listen to the whole episode to find out.  It might take a few sittings, but I promise it&#039;s worth your time investment.
I genuinely hope you enjoy the show.

		<itunes:summary>Today I delve deep with the magnificent and one and only Joel Kahn, M.D. to discuss the power of diet and lifestyle on heart health and long-term wellness.
Joel calls himself an Interpreventional Cardiolgist. What is that? It means that he treats his patients with a blend of traditional interventional cardiology (stents) as well as preventive cardiology. It&#039;s this rare combination that makes Dr. Kahn unique in his field.  
But let there be no mistake - Dr. Kahn is no new age hippie.  In additional to several post-doctorate certifications, he graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Michigan&#039;s prestigious Inteflex program (a 6-year undergraduate / graduate program that developed doctors fresh out of high school) and has served as a Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at Wayne State University School of Medicine since 1993.
In addition, Dr. Kahn has authored over 130 articles on heart disease, over 10 book chapters (as well as a new book due out in February 2014), and several monographs and video national presentations. He is a frequent lecturer on heart disease and its prevention. He has performed thousands of cardiac catheterizations and stent procedures and has been advising patients on heart healthy programs for over 20 years.
In other words, Dr. Kahn knows what he is talking about.  And his message is powerful -- if you want to experience true long-term wellness, then you must focus on implementing sustainable long-term preventive protocols into your lifestyle.  And this starts and ends with diet and active lifestyle.
It was an honor to spend 90 minutes with Dr. Kahn, and his message is invaluable.  Simply put, the world would be a better place if we had more doctors like him.  So listen up people.  
Take his message to heart. Literally. And enjoy.
Just a reminder that we&#039;re now up and running on Soundcloud for those of you that prefer this service.  Check out the show there &amp; follow us - I even created a few albums to help you find the episode and subject matter you are looking for, including a most popular episode album and episodes catalogued by subject matter - i.e., nutrition, fitness, entrepreneurs &amp; spirituality.  Good stuff.  For those unfamiliar, Soundcloud is great because it allows you to share your favorite episodes across your social networks and even embed shows on your website or blog with their super groovy player widget.  You can even add comments to the show specifically tagged to the referenced section / time code.

		<itunes:summary>Charlie Knoles is a visionary Vedic Meditation master teacher.  And today he joins Julie and I to de-mystify this ancient practice and demonstrate just how powerful implementing a simple and consistent meditation practice can be as an unparalleled tool for total life transformation.
Having taught thousands -- everyone from A-list celebrities, to Fortune 500 CEO&#039;s, entrepreneurs, artists, teachers, nurses, athletes and underprivileged youth, Charlie has developed a unique expertise in distilling seemingly elusive and arcane Vedic traditions down to their essence so that the deepest concepts from spirituality and science may be expressed in simple, practical steps that are accessible, easily assimilated and, he would submit, absolutely necessary as a precedent to finding inner peace and happiness. 
Formally taught to meditate at age 4 by his father, the pre-eminent master (or &quot;maharishi&quot;) Vedic Meditation teacher Thom Knoles, Charlie followed in the footsteps of his father, developing a new curriculum for training meditation teachers and running deeply immersive courses in Vedic culture in the Himalayan mountains of India and on the northern coast of Bali. His background as a musician, his study of science and his experience as the father of three young children allow him to integrate many streams of knowledge and foster a deep understanding in his students.  Today Charlie and Thom together run The Veda Center.
Julie and I first had the pleasure of meeting Charlie through our involvement with MindBodyGreen.  And what immediately struck me was just how grounded he is, particularly in comparison with other teachers I have encountered who tend to be, well let&#039;s just say more &quot;ethereal&quot;.  No robes or holier than thou attitude, Charlie is very much a normal dude in the &quot;world&quot; -- a husband, father of three young kids and even more of a photography and tech nerd than I am in fact.  It&#039;s this relatable &quot;normal guy&quot; quality that distinguishes him and allows his vast knowledge to penetrate so many.  Hence countless lives forever transformed.
Oh yeah - we&#039;re now up on Soundcloud! For those of you that prefer this service, check out the show there.  For those unfamiliar, Soundcloud is great because it allows you to share episodes across your social networks and even embed shows on your website or blog with their super groovy player widget.  You can even add comments to the show specifically tagged to the referenced section / time code.  And it&#039;s an amazing tool to further help get the word out about the podcast, so we appreciate any sharing or spreading you are inclined to do! For more info, click HERE.
Simultaneous with the launch of our Ultimate Guide to Plant-Based Nutrition, Charlie introduced his own MBG online course, The Essential Guide to Meditation, which entails over 6 hours of video content (plus access to an online support community) specifically designed to teach you everything you need to know to learn and master meditation and mindfulness -- irrespective of skill level.  Why? So you can access, develop and step in to your best, most actualized and authentic self -- which you may know by now is my favorite subject, and the consistent theme of this podcast.
I&#039;ve studied his program and I can say with full confidence that he delivers, and then some.  This program is a more than worthy investment of your time and energy.  I can&#039;t urge you enough to check it out.
On a personal level, I will freely admit that my practice could improve in consistency and depth -- I&#039;m spotty at best.  Despite the fact that I know very well just how much better I feel and function physically, mentally and emotionally when I am meditating consistently, I nonetheless struggle when it comes to making it the priority it deserves.  But after this interview, I am newly inspired to take my practice to the next level.  
So I am publicly committing that for the next 90 days, I am going to meditate twice a day, every day, without fail.

NOTE: Poor Julie.  She had the unfortunate displeasure of having to use our lousy third microphone for this interview, which is why her voice comes off a bit muffled - apologies for the sound quality; it's not her fault!  We are getting new equipment soon, including more top tier mics and recording equipment -- all thanks to your support with the donations, and use of the Amazon banner.  Thank you!

	<itunes:subtitle>John Joseph is a true American original.  John Joseph defines hardcore.  John Joseph is a spiritual warrior.  And he&#039;s got a message for you. First, let me say that this episode is EXPLICIT.  John simply can&#039;t be edited or muzzled,</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>John Joseph is a true American original.  John Joseph defines hardcore.  John Joseph is a spiritual warrior.  And he&#039;s got a message for you.
First, let me say that this episode is EXPLICIT.  John simply can&#039;t be edited or muzzled, and you wouldn&#039;t want him that way anyway.  He has a strong preference for four letter words.  He drops the f-bomb about a thousand times during the interview and recounts in technicolor detail the horrific, grizzly reality of his abusive upbringing, his criminal background and past penchant for violence in the underbelly of Manhattan&#039;s lower eat side in the 1970&#039;s and &#039;80&#039;s.  
So I&#039;m saying it now -- if you are easily offended, or this just isn&#039;t your cup of tea, then this may not be the episode for you.  That&#039;s fine.  Let&#039;s just say this one just isn&#039;t safe for the workplace.
Disclaimer aside, I love this guy.  It&#039;s rare to meet someone so raw; real and authentic.  Unafraid of life and certainly not shy when it comes to speaking his mind.  And in this interview he lays his truth bare.  With John, what you see and hear is exactly who he is.  And his message -- and life lessons -- are amongst the most powerful I have ever heard.
Conceived and raised in abuse.  Deprived of opportunity.  Left to his own devices.  John turned to violence and drugs to make his way in the world.  A path that led him to violence and crime -- teen years spent as a drug mule; in and out of of foster care; and stints in juvi and jail.  To avoid long-term incarceration, he enlisted in the Navy, only to go AWOL after a fight.
Fleeing the law and rudderless, John found redemption in the hardcore punk rock scene flourishing on the lower east side of Manhattan in the 1970&#039;s.  And under the wing of Bad Brains&#039; frontman H.R. -- a devotee of Rastafari -- John began to explore not just his musicianship, but his spirituality as well.  A journey that not only birthed the Cro-Mags -- one of the most iconic and influential hardcore punk bands of the 70&#039;s --  but led to life in a Hare Krishna monastery, where he found his spiritual salvation, developing his life-long love of meditation, yoga, sacred chanting, service to others -- and a diet devoid of animal products.
I&#039;m not sure I have ever met anyone who has successfully transcended circumstances as horrific as his upbringing and lived to tell about it. And although John may have been educated on the streets, his spiritual acumen is legit -- and vast.  Make no mistake, this guys walks his walk.  John is the true Thug Kitchen.
During this conversation we tap into it all, culminating in his newfound love for triathlon.  And how his deep connection to physical pursuit is a mere extension of his ongoing quest spiritual growth - something I can relate to entirely.
I&#039;m proud of this interview.  And I&#039;m proud to call John my friend.  But again - this is a super intense conversation.  Listen at your own risk.  But I hope you do.
UPDATE! We are now up and running on Soundcloud.  What&#039;s Soundcloud? Another platform to listen and share the podcast.  What&#039;s awesome is that it allows you to share the audio file across your social networks like Facebook and Pinterest and you can even embed this groovy player onto your website or blog.  You can even add comments along the timeline that specifically relate to a certain portion of the show, which is really fun.  Great way to share the content with your friends and colleagues and help spread the word.  So if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend, share away and let&#039;s build this PlantPower Mission together!
Here&#039;s a little additional background color on the guy to fill in the gaps...

NOTE: Not for nothing, John is correct - just seven months before lining up at Badwater, David Goggins did indeed break the Guinness 24-hour Pull-Up World Record with 4030 pull-ups!  To see a video of the effort, click HERE.

	<itunes:subtitle>Today on the show I sit down with my ultra running friend Josh Spector to talk all things Badwater.  Widely accepted as the &quot;World&#039;s Toughest Foot Race&quot;, Badwater is a 135 mile running race across Death Valley -- the hottest place on Earth,</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>Today on the show I sit down with my ultra running friend Josh Spector to talk all things Badwater.  Widely accepted as the &quot;World&#039;s Toughest Foot Race&quot;, Badwater is a 135 mile running race across Death Valley -- the hottest place on Earth, where temperatures average 120+ in July and can reach as high as 130 F with pavements temps typically in the 170-180 degree F range.
Starting at Badwater Basin -- the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level, approxmately 100 invitation-only runners from across the globe begin a jaunt that will take them across bleak and scorching desert terrain as well as three formidable mountain passes, including the culminating 13-mile ascent up the portals of Mt. Whitney -- the highest peak in the lower 48 -- to finish at 8,300 feet.
Yeah - it&#039;s that insane.
I had the honor &amp; privilege of being a member of Dean Karnazes&#039; crew this year, along with Jason Koop, Brandon Friese and Nathan Peerbolt.  Together we paced, fed, hydrated and generally did all we could to help Dean complete this unbelievable race for the 10th time.  It was an extraordinary experience -- one I won&#039;t soon forget.
Simultaneously, Josh -- himself an accomplished ultra runner with three 100-milers under his belt -- returned to Badwater for his third crewing experience, this time for runner Ray Sanchez.
In this episode we swap stories about the experience, giving the listener a rare peek at exactly what it&#039;s like to have a front row seat at what I have to say is one of the most incredible displays of the indomitable nature of the human spirit I have ever seen -- and will likely ever see.
Enjoy the show.

		<itunes:summary>Today my good buddies Brett Blankner -- the man behind the Zen &amp; The Art of Triathlon Podcast -- and Morgan Christian  -- of Metabender tracking &amp; Real Time Athlete -- stop by the garage to talk shop on all things endurance, multisport &amp; balancing life against training &amp; racing.  
This one is fun &amp; relaxed people.  These guys are a blast -- I hope my fondness for them comes through your earbuds.
I hope you enjoy the show!
UPDATE! We are now up and running on Soundcloud.  What&#039;s Soundcloud? Another platform to listen and share the podcast.  What&#039;s awesome is that it allows you to share the audio file across your social networks like Facebook and Pinterest and you can even embed this groovy player onto your website or blog.  You can even add comments along the timeline that specifically relate to a certain portion of the show, which is really fun.  Great way to share the content with your friends and colleagues and help spread the word.  So if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend, share away and let&#039;s build this PlantPower Mission together!

FINDING ULTRA NOW IN PAPERBACK
Finding Ultra recently hit bookstores and online retailers in paperback.  And it&#039;s cheap - just $12.45 on Amazon last time I checked.  What the heck, right?  That&#039;s like a one cold pressed juice at Whole Foods; and will hopefully be even a bit more nourishing.  Check it out.  Already read it? Then tell a friend.
Enjoying the show and inclined to help support the mission?  Then make sure you SUBSCRIBE ON ITUNES and LEAVE A (5-STAR?) REVIEW ON THE ITUNES SHOW PAGE.
Also, check out our new &quot;DONATE&quot; button on the right hand margin or click HERE to learn more.  Third, if, &amp; when you are about to buy something on Amazon, do us a solid and first click through to the Amazon site via the Amazon banner ad to the right (on the &quot;Podcasts&quot; page of RichRoll.com).  Won&#039;t cost you a penny extra on your purchase but will throw some loose change from the Amazon coffers our way, which we will use to keep the bandwidth flowing and improve production quality.

		<itunes:summary>My buddy Vinnie Tortorich -- ultra-cyclist, celebrity trainer, fellow podcast host and now author -- joins the show for a record 3rd appearance to talk about the release of his new book Fitness Confidential.  Part memoir, part fitness primer and part comedy, this book is your beach read for July.  Vinnie and I don&#039;t always see eye to eye on everything - particularly nutrition.  And he&#039;s not everyone&#039;s cup of tea.  But he&#039;s still my man -- we&#039;ve gone through a lot together and he has always been there for me.  
I love that Vinnie calls it like he sees it, doesn&#039;t pull punches and isn&#039;t afraid to call BS -- particularly when it comes to the latest health and/or nutrition fad.  If that appeals to you, then you&#039;ll love the book.  It&#039;s pure Vinnie, through and through
Writing a book is damn hard.  But what&#039;s even harder is getting people to read it after you spent years of blood, sweat, tears and toil to get it right.  I&#039;ve been there.  So the least I can do for my good friend is give him my microphone, let him tell you about the process first hand, and help him spread the word.
I hope you enjoy the show!

		<itunes:summary>I&#039;m so excited to share with you today&#039;s guest -- my favorite female pro triathlete Hillary Biscay.  Why is she my favorite? Oh, let me count the ways....First we have similar backgrounds as collegiate swimmers (although I promised not to hold her USC affiliation against her). And not only is she on the PlantPower bandwagon (all the cool kids are doing it these days...), she is also the first guest I&#039;ve had on the show who has also competed at Ultraman - it was great to hear her perspective on this race as a veteran pro.  So much to talk about, fresh off her 60th Ironman - yes you heard me right, 60 Ironmans! -- which was also one of her fastest.  Finally, anyone who lists &quot;running ultras&quot; as her &quot;hobby&quot; away from triathlon is definitely on my wavelength.
We get into all of it - what keeps her motivated; how her training has evolved from her days with legendary coach Brett Sutton to her current relationship with coach Siri Linley; how she fuels her training and racing on plants (including missteps along the way); and of course her personal experience racing Ultraman, and what that was like as an ironman professional.
Finally, we get to hear all about her new line of triathlon &amp; active apparel - Smash.  You know I love good design, and this stuff is excellent.  I just wish she would hurry up and start making stuff for guys.
Hillary is a delight, and she brings her vivaciousness to this interview in spades.  Enjoy.
UPDATE! We are now up and running on Soundcloud.  What&#039;s Soundcloud? Another platform to listen and share the podcast.

Great way to share the content with your friends and colleagues and help spread the word.  So if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend, share away and let&#039;s build this PlantPower Mission together!
THE CONTEST CONTINUES!
We are working hard on putting together a line of super groovy PlantPower-themed attire.  First up will be a t-shirt design, which we should have ready to print in the next two weeks - here&#039;s a peek at the logo design - what do you think?

This t-shirt can be yours for FREE.  Here&#039;s how to win:
1. Take an interesting photo of yourself either: a) reading Finding Ultra; or b) listening to the podcast;
2. Upload the photo to Instagram, Twitter or Facebook;
3. Tag the photo with my name (@richroll) AND the hashtag #plantpower
4.  Leave a comment on the iTunes page for the show HERE (unless you have already done so). I&#039;m not saying what you should write - that&#039;s entirely up to you.
I&#039;ll sort through the postings and pick the best -- and this is important -- MOST CREATIVE PHOTO and pick a winner.
UPDATE 6.25.13: Thanks for all the groovy posts.  I have decided to pick 2 winners - BE CREATIVE!
Good luck!

		<itunes:summary>Today on the show, my main man Dr. Shay Shani -- founder of Shani Clinic in Westlake Village, California-- the guy who keeps me injury free and my body functioning at 100%. 
As a board certified chiropractor, he makes sure I&#039;m always properly aligned.  But to say he&#039;s just a chiropractor is to vastly understate the scope of Shay&#039;s gifts. With advanced post-doctorate training in Functional Blood Chemistry and Functional Endocrinology, an unparalleled compassion for his patients and acute ability to get results, he is a rarity in the medical community for his keen focus not on treating symptoms but rather on uncovering the root cause of ailments, utilizing the most advanced non-invasive and all natural treatments to help patients with all varieties of chronic disease that do not improve in the current medical model. 
Having Shay in my life has undoubtedly made me a better athlete.  And more importantly a better man.  I&#039;m proud to call him my friend.  And even prouder to help share his powerful message with you.  So do yourself a favor. Strap in. Open your ears.  Learn.  And enjoy.
UPDATE! We are now up and running on Soundcloud.  What&#039;s Soundcloud? Another platform to listen and share the podcast.  What&#039;s awesome is that it allows you to share the audio file across your social networks like Facebook and Pinterest and you can even embed this groovy player onto your website or blog.  You can even add comments along the timeline that specifically relate to a certain portion of the show, which is really fun.  Great way to share the content with your friends and colleagues and help spread the word.  So if you enjoyed the show, tell a friend, share away and let&#039;s build this PlantPower Mission together!

		<itunes:summary>Today on the show I sit down with Gene Baur -- activist, best-selling author and president &amp; co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, the first animal rescue organization dedicated to farmed animals.  You might have seen him in the documentary Forks Over Knives.  And I&#039;d be remiss in not mentioning his is a pretty darn good marathon runner prepping for his first Ironman this summer (on a plant-based diet of course).

I&#039;ve had plenty of vegans with strong points of view on the program.  But this was the first time I have interviewed a true animal rights activist.  I&#039;m certainly not an expert in this area, but Gene is such a great guy, he made it easy.

I&#039;m the first to admit that my original reasons for going vegan were far more selfish than ethical.  But the more educated I become about how our food system functions to deliver meals to our plates, the more sensitive and attuned I have become to the indelible power of marketing; the extraordinary lengths to which BigFood and their adjuncts on Capitol Hill will go to keep the public immunized from the harsh realities of factory farming; and the unnecessary and horrific treatment of farm animals that inevitably results.

Please understand -- I take no moral high ground.  But as my awareness of this issue continues to broaden, I do feel a certain imperative to cast light on what I perceive as exceedingly cruel abuse on a systemic level.  In my very humble opinion, our current system is both untenable and unsustainable in the long term.  There is a better way.  And Gene is a great ambassador of a worthy message warranting our objective attention.

If you come to this interview with a different perspective on this issue, I understand. And it&#039;s fine. Believe me, I get it. I ask only one thing - that you please listen with an open and mind.

Thanks.  And enjoy the show.

Today on the show I visit New York&#039;s PS244 - The Active Learning Elementary School -- in Flushing, Queens to chat with science teacher and Director of the school&#039;s Wellness and Nutrition Program Christian Ledesma, as well as PS244&#039;s Principal Bob Groff to find out how PS244 became the first public school in the United States to institute a vegetarian school lunch.
But what I pleasantly discovered went well beyond a simple cafeteria upgrade.  PS244&#039;s revolutionary school lunch program is just the latest manifestation of a school founded on principals of wellness.  It&#039;s fair to say that the very fibre of PS244&#039;s  DNA is the promotion of holistic health for kids premised on the advancement of not just the mind, but that of the childrens&#039; bodies &amp; character.  
And it shows.  I saw food being grown in hanging gardens along the playground fences.  Kindergartners making their own granola bars and tasting blackberries in after-school programs.  Even a tower garden in the school library.  And that&#039;s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the day-to-day goings on at this special institute.

What PS244 has accomplished -- seemingly impossible within the confines of a very large &amp; bureaucratic urban school district -- is beyond inspiring.  And yet obviously doable when passion aligns with faith and hard work.  The bar is set.  And my hope is that this school&#039;s example will empower other teachers, administrators, principals, parents and students to take greater initiative in their own schools and districts and aspire for positive change.
Special thanks to Amie Hamlin, Executive Director of the New York Coalition for Healthy School Food.  It was her and this organization, working tirelessly for several years in alliance with the New York Department of Education, that made the impossible real.  My desire was to include Amie in this interview, but she was not in NYC on the day of my visit, so my plan is to interview her for a future podcast episode.  Stay tuned!
Enjoy the show.

What PS244 has accomplished -- seemingly impossible within the confines of a very large &amp; bureaucratic urban school district -- is beyond inspiring.  And yet obviously doable when passion aligns with faith and hard work.  The bar is set.  And my hope is that this school's example will empower other teachers, administrators, principals, parents and students to take greater initiative in their own schools and districts and aspire for positive change.
Special thanks to Amie Hamlin, Executive Director of the New York Coalition for Healthy School Food.  It was her and this organization, working tirelessly for several years in alliance with the New York Department of Education, that made the impossible real.  My desire was to include Amie in this interview, but she was not in NYC on the day of my visit, so my plan is to interview her for a future podcast episode.  Stay tuned!
Enjoy the show.

		<itunes:summary>Not only is Roni Selig one of my favorite people, she is one busy woman, so I am honored that she carved out some quality time to sit down with me and do the podcast in the midst of her immersive (to put it mildly) work schedule at CNN, where she has the heady title of Director of the CNN Medical, Health &amp; Wellness Unit in CNN&#039;s New York City headquarters high above Columbus Circle.  
In certain respects, I suppose this makes her Sanjay Gupta&#039;s boss -- heavy, right?  To provide some perspective, we were meant to conduct this interview about a month ago.  But as we sat in her office catching up prior to potting the mics, the Boston Marathon bombing occurred, and I had the rare opportunity to watch her -- and her team at the world&#039;s leading 24-hour international news network -- jump into action to begin covering the unbelievably tragic events as they unfolded in real time. It was impressive.  But needless to say, the horrible events of that day prevented the podcast from happening.  Lucky for me, I was back in NYC a month later.  No crazy breaking news that day, so we got it done.
Compelling is the fact that despite the time constraints and pressures of her incredibly demanding job -- amplified by her busy personal life as a wife and mother -- Roni still manages to find the time to pursue her passion -- triathlon -- and pursue it well.
We get into all aspects of her professional life -- behind the scenes at CNN Health; plus how she balances her personal life to train and compete as a high level age group endurance athlete, and her passion for CNN Fit Nation -- a program she oversees that involves a small group of civilians (hand selected annually from submissions) facing personal challenges committed to completing their first triathlon under the mentorship of CNN.
All said, Roni is a delight and an inspiration.  I hope you enjoy the interview as much as I (always) enjoy spending time with her.

THANK YOU
Just yesterday we eclipsed half a million downloads of this podcast.  That&#039;s over 500,000 listens - UNBELIEVABLE!  Thank you so much for tuning in.  It&#039;s been a dream.  I started this podcast on a whim while living in yurts on an organic farm on the North Shore of Kauai this past winter.  It was merely an experiment.  A creative outlet.  I would never have predicted that it would have found such a large audience.  Thank you.  I am beyond grateful.  Beyond humbled.  And committed more than ever to raise the bar on this show and double down on quality.  That&#039;s a promise.
FINDING ULTRA PAPERBACK IN TIME FOR FATHER&#039;S DAY
Last week Finding Ultra finally hit bookstores and online retailers in paperback.  It&#039;s an honor, as not every book published gets a paperback release.  So here I am again, pitching you with the hard sell.  It feels weird, but hey -- I&#039;m on my own here.  No publicist.  No press.  Plus, Random House basically told me they don&#039;t have the resources to market and promote the release.  So I&#039;m flying solo and need all the help I can get.
But I&#039;m not alone -- I&#039;ve got all of you, who have been beyond supportive.  So if you&#039;ve enjoyed the content I&#039;ve been freely sharing -- content that takes an obscene amount of my time to create -- and feel inclined to support the message I so passionately believe in, then this is the time I am REALLY ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.  
Already read the book?  Then get it as a gift for someone -- after all, Father&#039;s Day is coming up and you gotta get dear old dad something anyway.  Plus, it&#039;s darn cheap - just $12.99 on Amazon!  What the heck, right?  That&#039;s like a one cold pressed juice at Whole Foods; and will hopefully be even a bit more nourishing.  Then tell a friend.

		<itunes:summary>THE BEAST RETURNS!  
Once again, I&#039;m switching gears.  The interviewer becomes the interviewee.  Part II.
Mishka was a super popular guest on the podcast about a month ago.  If you listened to the interview, you know we went deep -- exhaustingly deep perhaps.  Despite the fact that I had never previously met Mishka face-to-face, I had a knowing sense that we would hit it off given our many points in common - writing, running, alcoholism &amp; sobriety.  There was an immediate short hand, and we just went straight to the core until we both felt like we were drowning in molten lava when the interview was over.
So when my publisher raised the issue of having someone interview me to coincide with the release of the paperback version of Finding Ultra -- hitting bookshelves and online retailers 5/21! -- I knew Mishka more than fit the bill.
Osher Günsberg hit the nail on the head with Part I of this self-involved and shameless self-promotional podcast double, and Mishka picks right up with Part II right where Osher left off -- repaying the favor of my unrepentant deep dive with him by hitting me hard with some tough questions as we peel back the layers and get behind the scenes on my book, my story and what drives both of us.
OK.  NOW FOR THE (HOPEFULLY NOT TOO) HARD SELL..... 
I feel weird asking people to buy the paperback.  I&#039;m sure the majority of you listeners out there have already read my book - you have, right?  RIGHT??  But then again, who knows?  Maybe you haven&#039;t.  Maybe you just stumbled upon this blog and podcast out of the blue.  So here is an opportunity to learn a bit more about me, why I wrote the book and what I hoped to express.
Oh yeah, there&#039;s also this little matter of admitting that I would like to move some units.  Maybe even make the NY Times Bestseller List for Non-Fiction Paperbacks - a list I narrowly missed with the hardcover release.  OK, busted.  Call me shameless.  Call me competitive.  Or, just shoot me.  I am formally apologizing right here and right now.  But hey, wouldn&#039;t you do the same if you had spent a couple years writing a book?  So cut me some slack.  I will say that if I do make the list -- an admitted (huge?) longshot, it will be entirely due to YOU -- the audience of this podcast and blog.

THE BEAST RETURNS!  
Once again, I'm switching gears.  The interviewer becomes the interviewee.  Part II.
Mishka was a super popular guest on the podcast about a month ago.  If you listened to the interview, you know we went deep -- exhaustingly deep perhaps.  Despite the fact that I had never previously met Mishka face-to-face, I had a knowing sense that we would hit it off given our many points in common - writing, running, alcoholism &amp; sobriety.  There was an immediate short hand, and we just went straight to the core until we both felt like we were drowning in molten lava when the interview was over.
So when my publisher raised the issue of having someone interview me to coincide with the release of the paperback version of Finding Ultra -- hitting bookshelves and online retailers 5/21! -- I knew Mishka more than fit the bill.
Osher Günsberg hit the nail on the head with Part I of this self-involved and shameless self-promotional podcast double, and Mishka picks right up with Part II right where Osher left off -- repaying the favor of my unrepentant deep dive with him by hitting me hard with some tough questions as we peel back the layers and get behind the scenes on my book, my story and what drives both of us.
OK.  NOW FOR THE (HOPEFULLY NOT TOO) HARD SELL..... 
I feel weird asking people to buy the paperback.  I'm sure the majority of you listeners out there have already read my book - you have, right?  RIGHT??  But then again, who knows?  Maybe you haven't.  Maybe you just stumbled upon this blog and podcast out of the blue.  So here is an opportunity to learn a bit more about me, why I wrote the book and what I hoped to express.
Oh yeah, there's also this little matter of admitting that I would like to move some units.  Maybe even make the NY Times Bestseller List for Non-Fiction Paperbacks - a list I narrowly missed with the hardcover release.  OK, busted.  Call me shameless.  Call me competitive.  Or, just shoot me.  I am formally apologizing right here and right now.  But hey, wouldn't you do the same if you had spent a couple years writing a book?  So cut me some slack.  I will say that if I do make the list -- an admitted (huge?) longshot, it will be entirely due to YOU -- the audience of this podcast and blog.  And hey, if my book and this podcast stand for anything, it's that we should all dream big.  Making that list is definitely a big dream of mine.
Moreover, the truth is, I ain't got no publicist out there shilling for me.  Plus, Random House basically told me they don't have the resources to market and promote the release -- basically no press to get the word out.  So I'm on my own.  But I'm not -- I've got all of you, who have been beyond supportive.

		<itunes:summary>Today we switch gears a bit.  
How?
This time the interviewer becomes the interviewee.  
Why?  
In just a few days (May 21st to be exact), the paperback version of Finding Ultra hits bookstores -- front table placement at Barnes &amp; Noble! -- or so I&#039;ve been told....I&#039;ll believe it when I see it -- and online retailers.  It&#039;s quite an honor that I am even getting a paperback release at all, and I want to make the most of the rare opportunity.  On that note, my publisher thought it might be fun to have someone interview me for a change.  Not to ask the same old questions I&#039;m always asked, but to kind of go beyond the typical &quot;Where do you get your protein?&quot; line of inquiry and delve deeper.  I must admit I wasn&#039;t to keen on the idea initially.  This podcast isn&#039;t really about me, it&#039;s about my guests; I&#039;m just the host.
Then again, if I could find the right person to do it -- somebody who knows me quite well and has something to really bring to the equation -- then maybe it could be cool.
Who?
Well I found the right guy.  Not only is Osher Günsberg a good friend, fellow plant-eater, marathon runner / aspiring ultra-runner and all-around cool dude, he&#039;s also a professional host.  Those Down Under likely know this swarthy, handome and dynamic gentleman as &quot;Andrew G.&quot; -- host of Australian Idol (Australia&#039;s version of American Idol) and from an array of other radio and television programs in both Australia and here in the U.S., including the CBS show Live To Dance, which he co-hosted with Paula Abdul.  In addition, he is a proud supporter of the Indigenous Marathon Project, which provides an opportunity for Indigenous men and women of Autralia to run the New York Marathon, which is not only inspiring but helps encourage healthy, active lifestyles.
A long way of saying he is total pro.  And in this interview, it shows.
Then there is this little matter of how -- in the right light -- we can appear to look somewhat similar.  Don&#039;t believe me?  Check the Instagram I posted the other day -- it&#039;s over the top; although he is admittedly far more handsome and charming than I.  Dopplegänger Günsberg.  Forgive the phrase -- I know it sounds like everyone&#039;s favorite hair band.  I guess I just wanted to write two words in a row with a diaeresis.
What For Again?
I feel weird asking people to buy the paperback.  I&#039;m sure the majority of you listeners out there have already read my book - you have, right?  RIGHT??  But then again, who knows?  Maybe you haven&#039;t.  Maybe you just stumbled upon this blog and podcast out of the blue.  So here is an opportunity to learn a bit more about me, why I wrote the book and what I hoped to express.
Oh yeah, there&#039;s also this little matter of admitting that I would like to move some units.

And hey, if my book and this podcast stand for anything, it&#039;s that we should all dream big.  Making that list is definitely a big dream of mine.
Moreover, the truth is, I ain&#039;t got no publicist out there shilling for me.  Plus, Random House basically told me they don&#039;t have the resources to market and promote the release -- basically no press to get the word out.  So I&#039;m on my own.  But I&#039;m not -- I&#039;ve got all of you, who have been beyond supportive.  So if you&#039;ve enjoyed the content I&#039;ve been freely sharing -- content that takes an obscene amount of my time to create -- and feel inclined to support the message I so passionately believe in, then this is the time I am REALLY ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.

		<itunes:summary>Today on the show I welcome nutritionist and dietitian Andy Bellatti MS, RD.  Sure we talk plant-based and other issues related to optimal nutrition (hint: eat REAL FOOD!).  
But what makes Andy unique amongst his peers isn&#039;t so much his pro-plant bias as it is his passion for calling out the inextricable link between giant food corporations and how we innately come to think and feel about the foods we (often unconsciously choose to) eat.  
From congressional legislation to school lunch policy, the food pyramid and what we are actually led to believe we need to live and thrive is in more ways than you would imagine completely dictated by these corporations, their lobbying efforts and Madison Avenue advertising agencies.  What makes Andy different is his courage to take a stand on this issue and his tireless push for positive changes, both systemic and individual.
Enjoy!

Today on the show I welcome nutritionist and dietitian Andy Bellatti MS, RD.  Sure we talk plant-based and other issues related to optimal nutrition (hint: eat REAL FOOD!).  
But what makes Andy unique amongst his peers isn't so much his pro-plant bias as it is his passion for calling out the inextricable link between giant food corporations and how we innately come to think and feel about the foods we (often unconsciously choose to) eat.  
From congressional legislation to school lunch policy, the food pyramid and what we are actually led to believe we need to live and thrive is in more ways than you would imagine completely dictated by these corporations, their lobbying efforts and Madison Avenue advertising agencies.  What makes Andy different is his courage to take a stand on this issue and his tireless push for positive changes, both systemic and individual.
Enjoy!

		<itunes:summary>Today on the podcast we GO DEEP.  
In the short lifespan of this show, I&#039;ve had the honor of interviewing a wide variety of incredible guests -- paradigm busting thought leaders pushing the boundaries of conventional wisdom on a myriad of health &amp; fitness related subject matters. But there is an elephant in the room.  I&#039;ve been waiting for the right guest to get into the issue closest to my heart -- addiction &amp; recovery.
If you read my book you know my story.  But I have been reluctant to use the podcast to discuss in depth the most integral part of my life &amp; struggle.  I suppose I was waiting for the right guest for the job.  Someone equipped to handle this kind of discussion.  Somebody who understands.
Well, I found him.  And when I say we go deep, I mean it&#039;s intense.  Big love to Mishka for the willingness to be vulnerable; open and considered in his responses.  It takes courage to be so transparent, and he&#039;s got it in spades.
In many ways, our stories are vastly different.  And yet they are exactly the same.  Alcoholism, struggle, recovery, writing, ultrarunning, redemption.  My long lost brother.  My peer.  My comrade in arms in the battle against the demon that wants both of us -- and untold millions -- drunk, imprisoned, institutionalized, and eventually dead.
Disclaimer: If you are stumbling onto this episode merely looking for training/nutrition tips, this interview might not be your cup of tea.  And if so, that&#039;s fine.  But I also know for a fact that there are a lot of people out there that will glean insight and inspiration from Mishka&#039;s redemptive journey.  All I can say is that I&#039;m really proud of this interview.  And I hope you enjoy it.
NOTE: there are a few moments of explicit language in case you are language sensitive.
ANOTHER NOTE: The song used to bridge the intro to the interview? &quot;The Only One Drinking Tonight,&quot; by Mishka Shubaly from &quot;How To Make A Bad Situation Worse&quot;

		<itunes:summary>Today on the podcast I am very pleased to host ultra-running legend Michael Arnstein, aka &quot;The Fruitarian&quot;.  Why the nickname?  because this guy is killing it on foot at distances from 26.2 all the way to 100 miles and beyond, powered almost entirely by raw fruit.

How is that even possible?  I thought I was extreme.  Tune in and find out.

Beyond his amazing accomplishments on foot, Michael was also on site at the Bostin marathon finish line.  His first-hand account of this unspeakable horror is reason enough to give the show a listen  during this melancholy and difficult time.

Michael was far too humble to promote himself on the show, so I&#039;m doing it for him.  For more info on how he gets it done, visit his website (below).  Also, he is the founder and host of the annual Woodstock Fruit Festival, being held this year on August 18-15 in Woodstock, NY.  Check it out -- I&#039;m going to try to make it myself.

In certain respects Jonathan is an &quot;everyman athlete&quot;, but he is far from ordinary.  Early morning it&#039;s up to train.

But his passion his health.  Particularly heart health.  I&#039;ll let him tell the story, but in a nutshell a health scare led him to a plant-based diet, and he&#039;s never looked back; sound familiar?
Jonathan took his passion for addressing our nation&#039;s heart disease crisis to the next level when he founded HeartView Global, a foundation devoted to two primary goals:

To identify heart disease in its latent “clinically silent” phase, thereby allowing asymptomatic but vulnerable individuals to undertake the necessary prophylactic lifestyle modifications and medications to arrest atherosclerosis - and for clinically unrecognized high risk individuals to undergo the necessary coronary interventions that will help prevent the development of heart attacks, stroke, or premature sudden cardiac death; and
To encourage a plant-based nutrition diet founded in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, along with some nuts and seeds. 

Jonathan is a great guy.  His message is powerful.  Tune in.  And thank me later.

		<itunes:summary>I cannot tell you how excited I am to share today&#039;s guest -- a man who needs no introduction -- triathlon legend Chris &quot;Macca&quot; McCormack.
This interview is PURE GOLD!
In case you&#039;ve been living under a rock and have never heard of Macca, he is one of the winningest triathletes of all time, dominant at all distances from sprint to Ironman.  He is a two-time Ironman World Champion and victor in over 200 triathlon races, including 12 Ironman titles, the 1997 ITU World Cup Series and the 1997 Triathlon World Championships, to name just a few.
If you are a fan of Macca, then you&#039;ve probably heard more than a few of his more outspoken -- but always entertaining -- interviews.  I didn&#039;t want to reap an over-plowed field, so I chose to instead focus on aspects of his life less well-known -- how he handles the balance of training and family life; how turning 40 has impacted his always evolving perspective on training and racing; and how he is learning to leverage social media as a service tool to help better communicate with and educate his amateur athlete fan base.  case in point - check out his MX12 Training Videos by clicking HERE.
I am super proud of this episode -- Chris could not have been more candid, engaging and fun.  I hope you enjoy the show as much as I enjoyed doing it!
Speaking of enjoying the show -- if you are, and inclined to help support what we are doing, then make sure you subscribe on iTunes and leave a comment on the iTunes page for the show.  Also, check out our new &quot;DONATE&quot; button on the right hand margin or click here to learn more.  Third, if, &amp; when you are about to buy something on Amazon, do us a solid and first click through to the Amazon site via the Amazon banner ad to the right (on the &quot;Podcasts&quot; page of RichRoll.com).  Won&#039;t cost you a penny extra on your purchase but will throw some loose change from the Amazon coffers our way, which we will use to keep the bandwidth flowing and improve production quality.
Finally, proud to announce that the paperback version of Finding Ultra is coming out on May 21.  Sure, that&#039;s still a bit off in the distance, but it&#039;s already up for pre-order on Amazon.  Pre-order now by clicking HERE and get it before it hits bookstores!

		<itunes:summary>Life should be lived passionately.

So says today&#039;s guest Lewis Howes, and I couldn&#039;t agree more.
If you are immersed in the online marketing world, you&#039;ve probably heard of Lewis -- a former professional football player &amp; renown pioneer lifestyle entrepreneur.  But in case you haven&#039;t, let me introduce you to his universe.
Lewis is a former two-sport All-American (football &amp; decathlon) and current world record holding athlete (most yards received in a single football game), has graced lists such as Details Magazine’s “5 Internet Gurus Who Can Make You Rich” and Incomediary.com’s “50 Most Influential People in Blogging.” Most recently, Lewis was ranked as one of Genjuice.com’s top “100 Most Desirable Mentors” along with the likes of Barack Obama, Russell Simmons and the Queen of Jordan.
In just three years, my man went from a depressed and aimless former professional Arena-league football player who&#039;s career was cut short due to injury sleeping on his sister’s couch to running a seven figure business. He began his entrepreneurial career by hosting LinkedIn meetups around the country, and co-authoring the successful book LinkedWorking. He has hosted over 400 webinars, spoken to thousands at conferences and events, and educated career professionals and business owners around the world on the power of LinkedIn.
Not enough?  He&#039;s also a member of the U.S. National Team Handball squad.  He loves CrossFit too.  Don&#039;t worry, we get into all of it.
Oh yeah, he&#039;s also the host of The School of Greatness Podcast, currently blowing up charts on iTunes.  I was honored to be a guest on his show a couple weeks back and am pleased that he joined me for an enlightening and inspiring chat about discovering, unlocking, and unleashing your best, most authentic self - my favorite subject.
I hope you dig the show and end up as inspired as I was sitting down with him in person.

		<itunes:summary>After a respite were back in the pod saddle with the stunning &amp; knowledgeable Natasha Kufa.  In addition to raising 4 kids, Natasha is an internationally renown nutritionist,  certified raw food specialist, chef &amp; food delivery proprietor and über-fit trainer, whose clients include A-list Hollywood celebrities such as Matthew McConaughey, Josh Duhamel &amp; his wife Fergie from The Black Eyed Peas, and more.
If that&#039;s not enough, Natasha is also the author of The 10% Rule: Small Changes, Big Results and is the owner and founder of Evolution Body -- a raw food delivery enterprise servicing the Los Angeles vicinity.
Topics covered? Colonics obsession, the joys &amp; challenges of raising an autistic child &amp; the impact of diet on spectrum behavior, the benefits of juicing, becoming a raw food chef, Natasha&#039;s fitness &amp; diet perpective, the importance of maintaining a healthy gut microbial ecology, vaccinations (uh oh!), the 10% Rule -- Natasha&#039;s primer for tackling &amp; ultimately overcoming barriers to healthy eating habits &amp; fitness practices -- and of course the question everyone wants to know: what it&#039;s like to train a big celebrity?
TECHNICAL NOTE: As you will no doubt notice, there are some odd clicking sounds with Natasha&#039;s microphone. Despite running some audio EQ, it nonetheless subsists.  Apologies in advance and as I keep saying (did I say I&#039;m apologizing?), I&#039;ll do better next time.  Or maybe it&#039;s time to get a real producer involved - which by the way, is in the works...

		<itunes:summary>Musician, author &amp; health philosopher king Sid Garza-Hillman joins the podcast to chat about all things PlantPower, including his new book, Approaching the Natural: A Health Manifesto.
More than just another book about plant-based nutrition, &quot;Approaching the Natural&quot; is a passionate and insightful primer on how we can achieve a more grounded, holistic, happy &amp; gratifying existence -- physically, mentally &amp; spiritually -- by connecting better with ourselves and the natural environment that surrounds us all.
Sid is a breath of fresh air and it was a pleasure to have him on the show.  Hope you enjoy the episode.
Also, if you are in Los Angeles, this evening (Wednesday, February 20) at 7:30 p.m. Sid and I will be speaking at BOOKPLATES, an ongoing series of exclusive insights from the literary world, at the Park la Brea Theatre.  For more information &amp; ticketing, click HERE.

The controversial founder of CrossFit Endurance stopped by the garage to illuminate me further on his perspective -- one that slays the sacred aerobic cow in favor of championing focused high intensity anaerobic work coupled with technique and functional body strength.

	<itunes:subtitle>Yes, this is a health &amp; fitness podcast.  But physical health is only one component of holistic wellness.  If your life feels amiss, your unfocused mind wanders or your spirit is adrift, then are you truly healthy in a complete sense?   Of course not.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>Yes, this is a health &amp; fitness podcast.  But physical health is only one component of holistic wellness.  If your life feels amiss, your unfocused mind wanders or your spirit is adrift, then are you truly healthy in a complete sense?  
Of course not.  So after several very nutrition and athlete focused episodes, it feels right to swing the pendulum from the physical back to the more ephemeral and return Julie Piatt to the co-host seat so we can roll up our sleeves and delve into matters less -- well, let&#039;s say &quot;tactile&quot; -- and examine what&#039;s behind the blocks preventing us from actualizing those latent dreams deferred that reside within all too many of us.  
It all starts and ends with creativity.  And creativity my friends, isn&#039;t just for &quot;artists&quot; -- because we are all artists, our lives and passions the expression of that art.  To wit:

What is impairing your ability to realize the best version of yourself?
What is a shadow artist and how can it be overcome?
Tools for tackling self-doubt, fear patterns &amp; obstacles to unlock &amp; unleash your latent creativity as a channel for manifesting positive life change.
And oh yeah, my feelings about Valentine&#039;s Day.....

Julie takes us out with &quot;I&#039;m Here Now&quot;, from her album Mother of Mine.

		<itunes:summary>Buckle up! Back by popular demand,  the controversial and outspoken Vinnie Tortorich -- &quot;America&#039;s Angriest Trainer&quot; and my favorite guy to ride a bike with -- returns to the podcast as my first repeat guest so we can throw down and get to the bottom -- for the very first time -- of what constitues the most ideal diet.  Is it &quot;low carb&quot; (Vinnie)? Or &quot;plant-based&quot; (Rich)?  Maybe something in between or alternatively something else entirely?
There can only be one winner in this argument, right?  Tune in to find out.  And we&#039;ll let you be the judge.  Whether or not you end up with some greater conviction or just more confused, only you can say.  At a minimum, and wherever you come down on the debate, you will feel moved by Vinnie&#039;s frankness about his past &amp; continuing battle with leukemia.
At one point in the interview, Vinnie makes the very controversial statement that there is no correlation between dietary fat and cardiovascular disease.  Just so we are clear, I do not share this view.  Give me an opportunity to dig into the research a bit more thoroughly and I will return to the blog and/or podcast with my supported findings.
NOTE: Despite my admonishments after his last tour on the show about keeping it all family friendly, Vinnie couldn&#039;t help himself and went off script with a few explicit lapses of the tongue.  Nothing crazy, but just a heads up if you&#039;re blasting it at work or happen to be unusually squeamish.  Apologies, but give him a break -- he is, after all, America&#039;s Angriest Trainer and has a reputation to maintain.

		<itunes:summary>UFC / MMA / BAMF James &quot;Lightning&quot; Wilks joins the podcast to talk PlantPower nutrition, what it&#039;s like to grapple in the UFC, his experience winning Season 9 of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;, his thoughts on &quot;low carb&quot; and Paleo-style diets, updates on the development of his documentary on plant-based athletes and how he fuels for performance.  Not only is James quite intelligent &amp; extremely articulate, his knowledge and passion when it comes to plant-based nutrition is palpable.  I hope you enjoy the interview.
Also, thanks Ed Gutentag -- cinematographer extraordinaire -- David Kitay and team for dropping by the garage to film today&#039;s episode.  At the moment, this is a rather low fi version of the HD film.  Given that it is a video in excess of 90 minutes it was the only way to get it up without a 48 hour upload time.  However, I&#039;m a luddite when it comes to properly configuring HD video for YouTube, so I&#039;ll try to get this figured out and swap it out for a better resolution version.  Apologies for a few audio tweaks in the video - a humming noise for a few minutes in the middle -- this is our first attempt at video and we&#039;ll get better as we go.

Won&#039;t cost you a penny extra on your purchase but will throw some loose change from the Amazon coffers our way, which we will use to keep the bandwidth flowing and improve production quality.

		<itunes:summary>Raw vegan runner extraordinaire Tim VanOrden joins the show to discuss his journey with food, how he re-discovered a passion for running that led him to 9 U.S. Masters Trail Championship victories, his holistic approach to life and how he makes it all work on a 100% entirely raw plant-based diet.

Along the way, we talk specifics about:

	aerobic zone training
	finding the joy in racing &amp; training
	the perils of becoming pigeonholed by labels
	the importance of microbial health
	what it&#039;s like to race up the Empire State Building
	his thoughts on supplementation, and 
	the ever-present protein question

I thought I knew a lot, but Tim enlightened me on more than a few issues and it was a pleasure interviewing him.

NOTE: apologies for the poor audio quality of the Skype interview. There is a persistent static hum that I could not eliminate and the levels are -- well, let&#039;s just say -- a wee bit off.  I am still new at all this and obviously still have a few things to learn. Production quality is important to me, so I am truly sorry for the issue. Hopefully Tim&#039;s passion and sagaciousness will overshadow the annoyance, and all I can say is that I promise to do better next time.

American record holder.  NCAA Champion.  And the first American under 48 seconds in the 100 meter freestyle.  Garrett Weber-Gale, one of the world&#039;s most decorated competitive swimmers, joins the podcast to talk with Rich about elite performance, professional athleticism, life (and food) at the Olympic Training Center, how he healed his high blood pressure with better nutrition, and his passion for fine cuisine cooking, quality eats and helping people.
NOTE: I am well aware that the audio on this Skype interview is less than ideal.  Issues with Skype not picking up my (Rich&#039;s) microphone properly.  Apologies.  Again, I&#039;m a newcomer at all this and can only promise to have it dialed in better next time.  Thanks for understanding (&amp; try not to hate).

		<itunes:summary>In today&#039;s episode, Rich talks with Michael Greger, M.D., the man behind the incredibly informative non-profit website NutritionFacts.org.  We discuss plant-based nutrition, the pros and cons of a wide variety of popular diets from Pritikin to Paleo to Atkins, and the impact of corporate food and pharmacuetical interests on everything from food marketing/labeling to the current state of nutrition research and medical school curriculums.
Dr. Greger then gets down to the nitty gritty on specific nutrition subjects like omega-3 fatty acid oil supplementation, the impact of antioxidant intake on exercise-induced oxidative stress and athletic adaptations to training, and of the course the hows and whys of protein intake.
At the end of the day?  All roads lead to kale.

		<itunes:summary>Today Julie and I discuss the perils of cycling on Kauai, a few adventures from our experience at Ultraman 2009 and some strategies for unlocking your more authentic self, followed by some incredible insight from Julie on self-sovereignty and navigating relationships.  The show closes with a live performance of Julie&#039;s song &quot;In the Sun&quot; with our son Tyler on guitar.
We hope you enjoy the program.
As of today, we are the #1 podcast on iTunes in the Health category (first 3 episodes all in the top 10) and the #22 podcast overall for all of iTunes.  Showing up on a list that includes such tremendous talent -- names like Ira Glass, Adam Carolla, Joe Rogan and Alec Baldwin -- is beyond an honor.  Even more astounding given that we just started this little show last week.  So THANK YOU for your support.  We will do our best to live up to the early hype and continue to provide helpful, informative, enlightening and entertaining content.  If you haven&#039;t yet, you can subscribe on iTunes HERE.

Super excited that I actually found the Popeye cartoon I mentioned -- produced in 1953.  Check out Sweet Pea - living in the mystery of the moment!

Finally, Julie mentioned that we made a movie together.  We did (I directed &amp; Julie and &amp; I co-wrote it back in 2005).  A short film actually.  It&#039;s called &quot;Down Dog&quot; -- and if I do say so myself, it&#039;s pretty darn funny.  So check it out HERE if you have 20 minutes to kill.

		<itunes:summary>In the debut episode of the Rich Roll Podcast, Rich converses with his wife Julie Piatt about life in Kauai, sustainable lifestyle, enhancing your personal creativity and homeschooling.

Finally!

I&#039;ve been talking about doing a podcast for what seems like eons.  For whatever reason, I just couldn&#039;t seem to get around to actually figuring out how to do it, let alone get it done.  But I finally found the time to sort through at least the initial barrier configuration issues and am happy to announce my virgin episode, which features my wife and (much) better half Julie Piatt.

We are still sorting through some tech issues so it&#039;s far from studio polished, aside from the killer intro / outro music courtesy of my very talented son Tyler and nephew Harrison!  The sound from this episode is admittedly a bit echo-y due to the warehouse recording environment-- and I have yet to configure it for video and livestream broadcasting, which I am currently working on.  But rather than wait until I had everything perfect, I wanted to just begin.  Start slow and organically and let it grow as I find my voice and legs so to speak.  I&#039;m far from a professional broadcaster, but I hope that through this effort I can bring some insights and interesting people to your ears that will both enlighten, provoke and entertain.

First off - this is NOT a &quot;triathlon training / coaching&quot; styled podcast.  There are plenty of those out there already that are very well done (Zen Triathlon and IMTalk are my faves for this), so if you are looking for a podcast that is very narrowly tailored to this specific subject and this subject only, then I fear my program may not be exactly what you are looking for.  And yet, I implore to nonetheless give it a trial run with an open mind (and ears).

Instead, my plan is to provide a long-form discussion platform to raise and converse about a wide variety of subjects that interest me.  Certainly, triathlon, running, cycling, swimming, training, fitness in general and everything that goes into that is of course a subject that interests me dearly, so of course I will be programming helpful information in this regard.  But my focus will broaden from there into plant-based nutrition for the athlete and everyman (and woman); wellness in general; spirituality; yoga &amp; meditation; and sustainable lifestyle.

Most importantly, my desire is to create a platform to help lead the way to unlocking the best version of yourself.  How to live more authentically.  And thrive from the heart.

I hope you enjoy this first episode.  Many more in the works and I hope to record at least 2 to 3 of these per week.

I am very interested in your thoughts on the episode, comments in general and ideas for future episodes.  In the comments section below, PLEASE let me know what YOU think, would be interested in hearing me talk about in future episodes, people you would like me to interview, and anything else on your mind.  I&#039;m wide open.



Feel free to share.  In fact, if you enjoyed the piece I would love it if you could help spread the word.  You can even embed the audio player on your site as you wish.

The podcast is now live on Stitcher (see widget below) and has been submitted to iTunes &amp; Blackberry services and should be available for subscription and download on those various sometime in the next 48 hours, at which point I will update this post with the subscription links.

NOTE: 11.29.12: The podcast is now live on iTunes HERE

Thanks for listening and look forward to your thoughts.

Peace + Plants!
